               THE COMEDY OF ERRORS

                  ACT I. SCENE 1

            A hall in the DUKE'S palace

      Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchant
     of Syracuse, GAOLER, OFFICERS, and other ATTENDANTS

  AEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
    And by the doom of death end woes and all.
  DUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
    I am not partial to infringe our laws.
    The enmity and discord which of late
    Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
    To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
    Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
    Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
    Excludes all pity from our threat'ning looks.
    For, since the mortal and intestine jars
    'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
    It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
    Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
    To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;
    Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus
    Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;
    Again, if any Syracusian born
    Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,
    His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose,
    Unless a thousand marks be levied,
    To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
    Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
    Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
    Therefore by law thou art condemn'd to die.
  AEGEON. Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
    My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
  DUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
    Why thou departed'st from thy native home,
    And for what cause thou cam'st to Ephesus.
  AEGEON. A heavier task could not have been impos'd
    Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;
    Yet, that the world may witness that my end
    Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
    I'll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
    In Syracuse was I born, and wed
    Unto a woman, happy but for me,
    And by me, had not our hap been bad.
    With her I liv'd in joy; our wealth increas'd
    By prosperous voyages I often made
    To Epidamnum; till my factor's death,
    And the great care of goods at random left,
    Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
    From whom my absence was not six months old,
    Before herself, almost at fainting under
    The pleasing punishment that women bear,
    Had made provision for her following me,
    And soon and safe arrived where I was.
    There had she not been long but she became
    A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
    And, which was strange, the one so like the other
    As could not be disdnguish'd but by names.
    That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
    A mean woman was delivered
    Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.
    Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
    I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.
    My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
    Made daily motions for our home return;
    Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon
    We came aboard.
    A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd
    Before the always-wind-obeying deep
    Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
    But longer did we not retain much hope,
    For what obscured light the heavens did grant
    Did but convey unto our fearful minds
    A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
    Which though myself would gladly have embrac'd,
    Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
    Weeping before for what she saw must come,
    And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
    That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
    Forc'd me to seek delays for them and me.
    And this it was, for other means was none:
    The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
    And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;
    My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
    Had fast'ned him unto a small spare mast,
    Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;
    To him one of the other twins was bound,
    Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
    The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I,
    Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
    Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast,
    And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,
    Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
    At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
    Dispers'd those vapours that offended us;
    And, by the benefit of his wished light,
    The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
    Two ships from far making amain to us-
    Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
    But ere they came-O, let me say no more!
    Gather the sequel by that went before.
  DUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;
    For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
  AEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now
    Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
    For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
    We were encount'red by a mighty rock,
    Which being violently borne upon,
    Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
    So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
    Fortune had left to both of us alike
    What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
    Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened
    With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
    Was carried with more speed before the wind;
    And in our sight they three were taken up
    By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
    At length another ship had seiz'd on us;
    And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
    Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck'd guests,
    And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
    Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
    And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
    Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss,
    That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
    To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
  DUKE. And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
    Do me the favour to dilate at full
    What have befall'n of them and thee till now.
  AEGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
    At eighteen years became inquisitive
    After his brother, and importun'd me
    That his attendant-so his case was like,
    Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-
    Might bear him company in the quest of him;
    Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,
    I hazarded the loss of whom I lov'd.
    Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
    Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
    And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
    Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
    Or that or any place that harbours men.
    But here must end the story of my life;
    And happy were I in my timely death,
    Could all my travels warrant me they live.
  DUKE. Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd
    To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
    Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
    Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
    Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
    My soul should sue as advocate for thee.
    But though thou art adjudged to the death,
    And passed sentence may not be recall'd
    But to our honour's great disparagement,
    Yet will I favour thee in what I can.
    Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
    To seek thy help by beneficial hap.
    Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
    Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
    And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
    Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
  GAOLER. I will, my lord.
  AEGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,
    But to procrastinate his lifeless end.                     Exeunt
                       SCENE 2

                      The mart

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE,
                 and FIRST MERCHANT

  FIRST MERCHANT. Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,
    Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
    This very day a Syracusian merchant
    Is apprehended for arrival here;
    And, not being able to buy out his life,
    According to the statute of the town,
    Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
    There is your money that I had to keep.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.
    And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
    Within this hour it will be dinner-time;
    Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
    Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
    And then return and sleep within mine inn;
    For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
    Get thee away.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man would take you at your word,
    And go indeed, having so good a mean.                        Exit
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
    When I am dull with care and melancholy,
    Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
    What, will you walk with me about the town,
    And then go to my inn and dine with me?
  FIRST MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
    Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
    I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
    Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart,
    And afterward consort you till bed time.
    My present business calls me from you now.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
    And wander up and down to view the city.
  FIRST MERCHANT. Sir, I commend you to your own content.
                                                  Exit FIRST MERCHANT
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content
    Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
    I to the world am like a drop of water
    That in the ocean seeks another drop,
    Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
    Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.
    So I, to find a mother and a brother,
    In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

                  Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Here comes the almanac of my true date.
    What now? How chance thou art return'd so soon?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late.
    The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;
    The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell-
    My mistress made it one upon my cheek;
    She is so hot because the meat is cold,
    The meat is cold because you come not home,
    You come not home because you have no stomach,
    You have no stomach, having broke your fast;
    But we, that know what 'tis to fast and pray,
    Are penitent for your default to-day.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I
      pray:
    Where have you left the money that I gave you?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last
    To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
    The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;
    Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
    We being strangers here, how dar'st thou trust
    So great a charge from thine own custody?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
    I from my mistress come to you in post;
    If I return, I shall be post indeed,
    For she will score your fault upon my pate.
    Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
    And strike you home without a messenger.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of
      season;
    Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
    Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.
    ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your
      foolishness,
    And tell me how thou hast dispos'd thy charge.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
    Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.
    My mistress and her sister stays for you.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me
    In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
    Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,
    That stands on tricks when I am undispos'd.
    Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
    Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
    But not a thousand marks between you both.
    If I should pay your worship those again,
    Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress' marks! What mistress, slave,
      hast thou?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
    She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
    And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
    Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.        [Beats him]
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? For God's sake hold your
      hands!
    Nay, an you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.               Exit
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other
    The villain is o'erraught of all my money.
    They say this town is full of cozenage;
    As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
    Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
    Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
    Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
    And many such-like liberties of sin;
    If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
    I'll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.
    I greatly fear my money is not safe.                         Exit
                   ACT Il. SCENE 1

          The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

    Enter ADRIANA, wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, with
                 LUCIANA, her sister

  ADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return'd
    That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
    Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
  LUCIANA. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
    And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner;
    Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.
    A man is master of his liberty;
    Time is their master, and when they see time,
    They'll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.
  ADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?
  LUCIANA. Because their business still lies out o' door.
  ADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
  LUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your will.
  ADRIANA. There's none but asses will be bridled so.
  LUCIANA. Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
    There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
    But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.
    The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
    Are their males' subjects, and at their controls.
    Man, more divine, the master of all these,
    Lord of the wide world and wild wat'ry seas,
    Indu'd with intellectual sense and souls,
    Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
    Are masters to their females, and their lords;
    Then let your will attend on their accords.
  ADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
  LUCIANA. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
  ADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
  LUCIANA. Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
  ADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?
  LUCIANA. Till he come home again, I would forbear.
  ADRIANA. Patience unmov'd! no marvel though she pause:
    They can be meek that have no other cause.
    A wretched soul, bruis'd with adversity,
    We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
    But were we burd'ned with like weight of pain,
    As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.
    So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
    With urging helpless patience would relieve me;
    But if thou live to see like right bereft,
    This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
  LUCIANA. Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
    Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.

              Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS

  ADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two
    ears can witness.
  ADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know'st thou his mind?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.
    Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
  LUCIANA. Spake he so doubtfully thou could'st not feel his meaning?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he struck so plainly I could to
    well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could
    scarce understand them.
  ADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
    It seems he hath great care to please his wife.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
  ADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad;
    But, sure, he is stark mad.
    When I desir'd him to come home to dinner,
    He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold.
    "Tis dinner time' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
    'Your meat doth burn' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
    'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
    'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
    'The pig' quoth I 'is burn'd'; 'My gold!' quoth he.
    'My mistress, sir,' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress;
    I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress.'
  LUCIANA. Quoth who?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master.
    'I know' quoth he 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
    So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
    I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
    For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
  ADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back again, and be new beaten home?
    For God's sake, send some other messenger.
  ADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will bless that cross with other beating;
    Between you I shall have a holy head.
  ADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so round with you, as you with me,
    That like a football you do spurn me thus?
    You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither;
    If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.      Exit
  LUCIANA. Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!
  ADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,
    Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
    Hath homely age th' alluring beauty took
    From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.
    Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?
    If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
    Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.
    Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
    That's not my fault; he's master of my state.
    What ruins are in me that can be found
    By him not ruin'd? Then is he the ground
    Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
    A sunny look of his would soon repair.
    But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
    And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
  LUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.
  ADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
    I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;
    Or else what lets it but he would be here?
    Sister, you know he promis'd me a chain;
    Would that alone a love he would detain,
    So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
    I see the jewel best enamelled
    Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still
    That others touch and, often touching, will
    Where gold; and no man that hath a name
    By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
    Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
    I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
  LUCIANA. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!             Exeunt
                       SCENE 2

                      The mart

              Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
    Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
    Is wand'red forth in care to seek me out.
    By computation and mine host's report
    I could not speak with Dromio since at first
    I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

               Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    How now, sir, is your merry humour alter'd?
    As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
    You know no Centaur! You receiv'd no gold!
    Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!
    My house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,
    That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I did not see you since you sent me hence,
    Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
    And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
    For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeas'd.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
    What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the
      teeth?
    Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
                                                        [Beating him]
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God's sake! Now your jest is
      earnest.
    Upon what bargain do you give it me?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes
    Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
    Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
    And make a common of my serious hours.
    When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
    But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
    If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
    And fashion your demeanour to my looks,
    Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, call you it? So you would
    leave battering, I had rather have it a head. An you use
    these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and
    insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
    But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say
    every why hath a wherefore.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then
      wherefore,
    For urging it the second time to me.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of
      season,
    When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?
    Well, sir, I thank you.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, for this something that you gave
    me for nothing.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I'll make you amends next, to
    give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinnertime?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what's that?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me
    another dry basting.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;
    there's a time for all things.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have denied that, before you
    were so choleric.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the
    plain bald pate of Father Time himself.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let's hear it.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There's no time for a man to recover
    his hair that grows bald by nature.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and
    recover the lost hair of another man.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of
    hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a blessing that he bestows
    on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
    given them in wit.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there's many a man
    hath more hair than wit.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the
    wit to lose his hair.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy
    men plain dealers without wit.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost;
    yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and sound ones too.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in
    tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his
    porridge.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov'd there
    is no time for all things.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
    hair lost by nature.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why
    there is no time to recover.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,
    and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew 't'would be a bald conclusion. But,
    soft, who wafts us yonder?

                  Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

  ADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.
    Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
    I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
    The time was once when thou unurg'd wouldst vow
    That never words were music to thine ear,
    That never object pleasing in thine eye,
    That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
    That never meat sweet-savour'd in thy taste,
    Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carv'd to thee.
    How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
    That thou art then estranged from thyself?
    Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
    That, undividable, incorporate,
    Am better than thy dear self's better part.
    Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;
    For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
    A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
    And take unmingled thence that drop again
    Without addition or diminishing,
    As take from me thyself, and not me too.
    How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
    Should'st thou but hear I were licentious,
    And that this body, consecrate to thee,
    By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
    Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,
    And hurl the name of husband in my face,
    And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow,
    And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
    And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
    I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.
    I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
    My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;
    For if we two be one, and thou play false,
    I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
    Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
    Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;
    I live dis-stain'd, thou undishonoured.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
    In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
    As strange unto your town as to your talk,
    Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
    Wants wit in all one word to understand.
  LUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang'd with you!
    When were you wont to use my sister thus?
    She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?
  ADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him-
    That he did buffet thee, and in his blows
    Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this
      gentlewoman?
    What is the course and drift of your compact?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, Sir? I never saw her till this time.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
    Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I never spake with her in all my life.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our
      names,
    Unless it be by inspiration?
  ADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity
    To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
    Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
    Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
    But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
    Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;
    Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
    Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
    Makes me with thy strength to communicate.
    If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
    Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
    Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion
    Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for
      her theme.
    What, was I married to her in my dream?
    Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?
    What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
    Until I know this sure uncertainty,
    I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
  LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cross me for sinner.
    This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!
    We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.
    If we obey them not, this will ensue:
    They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
  LUCIANA. Why prat'st thou to thyself, and answer'st not?
    Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am not I?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.
  LUCIANA. If thou art chang'd to aught, 'tis to an ass.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for grass.
    'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
    But I should know her as well as she knows me.
  ADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
    To put the finger in the eye and weep,
    Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.
    Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
    Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day,
    And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
    Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
    Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
    Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
    Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis'd?
    Known unto these, and to myself disguis'd!
    I'll say as they say, and persever so,
    And in this mist at all adventures go.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
  ADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
  LUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.           Exeunt
                  ACT III. SCENE 1

      Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS,
                ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR

  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
    My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.
    Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
    To see the making of her carcanet,
    And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
    But here's a villain that would face me down
    He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
    And charg'd him with a thousand marks in gold,
    And that I did deny my wife and house.
    Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know.
    That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;
    If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
    Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Marry, so it doth appear
    By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
    I should kick, being kick'd; and being at that pass,
    You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our
      cheer
    May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
  BALTHAZAR. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or
      fish,
    A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.
  BALTHAZAR. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that's nothing
    but words.
  BALTHAZAR. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing
      guest.
    But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
    Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
    But, soft, my door is lock'd; go bid them let us in.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
      idiot, patch!
    Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
    Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store,
    When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
      the street.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Let him walk from whence he came,
      lest he catch cold on's feet.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an
      you'll tell me wherefore.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner; I have
      not din'd to-day.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Nor to-day here you must
      not; come again when you may.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep'st me out
      from the house I owe?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  The porter for this time,
      sir, and my name is Dromio.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Villain, thou hast stol'n both mine
      office and my name!
    The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
    If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
    Thou wouldst have chang'd thy face for a name, or thy name for
      an ass.

                    Enter LUCE, within

  LUCE.  [Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are
      those at the gate?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Let my master in, Luce.
  LUCE.  [Within]  Faith, no, he comes too late;
    And so tell your master.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Lord, I must laugh!
    Have at you with a proverb: Shall I set in my staff?
  LUCE.  [Within]  Have at you with another: that's-when? can you
      tell?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  If thy name be called Luce
      -Luce, thou hast answer'd him well.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You'll let us in,
      I hope?
  LUCE.  [Within]  I thought to have ask'd you.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  And you said no.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. SO, Come, help: well struck! there was blow
      for blow.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.
  LUCE.  [Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, knock the door hard.
  LUCE.  [Within]  Let him knock till it ache.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the
      door down.
  LUCE.  [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the
      town?

                  Enter ADRIANA, within

  ADRIANA.  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all
      this noise?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  By my troth, your town is
      troubled with unruly boys.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might
      have come before.
  ADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. If YOU went in pain, master, this 'knave' would
      go sore.
  ANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would
      fain have either.
  BALTHAZAR. In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. They stand at the door, master; bid them
      welcome hither.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind,
      that we cannot get in.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. You would say so, master, if your garments were
      thin.
    Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold;
    It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break
      ope the gate.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Break any breaking here,
      and I'll break your knave's pate.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A man may break a word with you,
      sir; and words are but wind;
    Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking; out
      upon thee, hind!
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's too much 'out upon thee!' pray thee
      let me in.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Ay, when fowls have no
      feathers and fish have no fin.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I'll break in; go borrow me a crow.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
    For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
    If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
  BALTHAZAR. Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
    Herein you war against your reputation,
    And draw within the compass of suspect
    Th' unviolated honour of your wife.
    Once this-your long experience of her wisdom,
    Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,
    Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
    And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
    Why at this time the doors are made against you.
    Be rul'd by me: depart in patience,
    And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
    And, about evening, come yourself alone
    To know the reason of this strange restraint.
    If by strong hand you offer to break in
    Now in the stirring passage of the day,
    A vulgar comment will be made of it,
    And that supposed by the common rout
    Against your yet ungalled estimation
    That may with foul intrusion enter in
    And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
    For slander lives upon succession,
    For ever hous'd where it gets possession.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail'd. I will depart in quiet,
    And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.
    I know a wench of excellent discourse,
    Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;
    There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
    My wife-but, I protest, without desert-
    Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;
    To her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home
    And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made.
    Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
    For there's the house. That chain will I bestow-
    Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-
    Upon mine hostess there; good sir, make haste.
    Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
    I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
  ANGELO. I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some expense.
                                                               Exeunt
                        SCENE 2

        Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

        Enter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

  LUCIANA. And may it be that you have quite forgot
    A husband's office? Shall, Antipholus,
    Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
    Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
    If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
    Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness;
    Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
    Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;
    Let not my sister read it in your eye;
    Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
    Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;
    Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
    Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
    Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
    Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?
    What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
    'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed
    And let her read it in thy looks at board;
    Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
    Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.
    Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
    Being compact of credit, that you love us;
    Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
    We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
    Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
    Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.
    'Tis holy sport to be a little vain
    When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else,
      I know not,
    Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine-
    Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
    Than our earth's wonder-more than earth, divine.
    Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
    Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
    Smoth'red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
    The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
    Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
    To make it wander in an unknown field?
    Are you a god? Would you create me new?
    Transform me, then, and to your pow'r I'll yield.
    But if that I am I, then well I know
    Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
    Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;
    Far more, far more, to you do I decline.
    O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
    To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears.
    Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;
    Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
    And as a bed I'll take them, and there he;
    And in that glorious supposition think
    He gains by death that hath such means to die.
    Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.
  LUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
  LUCIANA. It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair
      sun, being by.
  LUCIANA. Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on
      night.
  LUCIANA. Why call you me love? Call my sister so.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister's sister.
  LUCIANA. That's my sister.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;
    It is thyself, mine own self's better part;
    Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
    My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope's aim,
    My sole earth's heaven, and my heaven's claim.
  LUCIANA. All this my sister is, or else should be.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee;
    Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;
    Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.
    Give me thy hand.
  LUCIANA. O, soft, sir, hold you still;
    I'll fetch my sister to get her good will.           Exit LUCIANA

                  Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run'st thou
    so fast?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio?
    Am I your man? Am I myself?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my
    man, thou art thyself.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am an ass, I am a woman's man, and besides
    myself.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman's man, and how besides thyself?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due
    to a woman-one that claims me, one that haunts me, one
    that will have me.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, such claim as you would
    lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not
    that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
    being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A very reverent body; ay, such a one
    as a man may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.'
    I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
    wondrous fat marriage.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, she's the kitchen-wench,
    and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but
    to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.
    I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn
    Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she'll burn
    week longer than the whole world.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Swart, like my shoe; but her face
    nothing like so clean kept; for why, she sweats, a man may
    go over shoes in the grime of it.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That's a fault that water will mend.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood
    could not do it.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What's her name?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nell, sir; but her name and three
    quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure
    her from hip to hip.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No longer from head to foot than
    from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find
    out countries in her.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out by
    the bogs.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I found it by the barrenness, hard in
    the palm of the hand.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. In her forehead, arm'd and reverted,
    making war against her heir.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I look'd for the chalky cliffs, but I
    could find no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her
    chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in
    her breath.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, sir, upon her nose, an o'er embellished with
    rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the
    hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be
    ballast at her nose.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, Sir, I did not look so low. To
    conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me; call'd me
    Dromio; swore I was assur'd to her; told me what privy
    marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the
    mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I,
    amaz'd, ran from her as a witch.
    And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith, and
      my heart of steel,
    She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn
      i' th' wheel.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;
    An if the wind blow any way from shore,
    I will not harbour in this town to-night.
    If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
    Where I will walk till thou return to me.
    If every one knows us, and we know none,
    'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. As from a bear a man would run for life,
    So fly I from her that would be my wife.                     Exit
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's none but witches do inhabit here,
    And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
    She that doth call me husband, even my soul
    Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
    Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
    Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
    Hath almost made me traitor to myself;
    But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
    I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

               Enter ANGELO with the chain

  ANGELO. Master Antipholus!
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that's my name.
  ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.
    I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine;
    The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with this?
  ANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
  ANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.
    Go home with it, and please your wife withal;
    And soon at supper-time I'll visit you,
    And then receive my money for the chain.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
    For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
  ANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.               Exit
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:
    But this I think, there's no man is so vain
    That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
    I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
    When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
    I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;
    If any ship put out, then straight away.                     Exit
                     ACT IV. SCENE 1

                     A public place

       Enter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OFFICER

  SECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
    And since I have not much importun'd you;
    Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
    To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.
    Therefore make present satisfaction,
    Or I'll attach you by this officer.
  ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you
    Is growing to me by Antipholus;
    And in the instant that I met with you
    He had of me a chain; at five o'clock
    I shall receive the money for the same.
    Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
    I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS,
                 from the COURTEZAN'S

  OFFICER. That labour may you save; see where he comes.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
    And buy a rope's end; that will I bestow
    Among my wife and her confederates,
    For locking me out of my doors by day.
    But, soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
    Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I buy a thousand pound a year; I buy a rope.
                                                          Exit DROMIO
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. A man is well holp up that trusts to you!
    I promised your presence and the chain;
    But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
    Belike you thought our love would last too long,
    If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
  ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note
    How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
    The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,
    Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
    Than I stand debted to this gentleman.
    I pray you see him presently discharg'd,
    For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money;
    Besides, I have some business in the town.
    Good signior, take the stranger to my house,
    And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
    Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.
    Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
  ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time
      enough.
  ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
    Or else you may return without your money.
  ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;
    Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
    And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
    Your breach of promise to the Porpentine;
    I should have chid you for not bringing it,
    But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
  SECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
  ANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your
      money.
  ANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
    Either send the chain or send by me some token.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of breath!
    Come, where's the chain? I pray you let me see it.
  SECOND MERCHANT. My business cannot brook this dalliance.
    Good sir, say whe'r you'll answer me or no;
    If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?
  ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.
  ANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to
      say so.
  ANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
    Consider how it stands upon my credit.
  SECOND MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
  OFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me.
  ANGELO. This touches me in reputation.
    Either consent to pay this sum for me,
    Or I attach you by this officer.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!
    Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar'st.
  ANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.
    I would not spare my brother in this case,
    If he should scorn me so apparently.
  OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
    But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
    As all the metal in your shop will answer.
  ANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
    To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.

          Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bay

  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there's a bark of Epidamnum
    That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
    And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
    I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
    The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx.
    The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
    Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at an
    But for their owner, master, and yourself.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
    What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;
    And told thee to what purpose and what end.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. YOU sent me for a rope's end as soon-
    You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,
    And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
    To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;
    Give her this key, and tell her in the desk
    That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry
    There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.
    Tell her I am arrested in the street,
    And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone.
    On, officer, to prison till it come.        Exeunt all but DROMIO
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana! that is where we din'd,
    Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.
    She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
    Thither I must, although against my will,
    For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.               Exit
                        SCENE 2

          The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS

               Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

  ADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
    Might'st thou perceive austerely in his eye
    That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no?
    Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
    What observation mad'st thou in this case
    Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
  LUCIANA. First he denied you had in him no right.
  ADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.
  LUCIANA. Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
  ADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
  LUCIANA. Then pleaded I for you.
  ADRIANA. And what said he?
  LUCIANA. That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
  ADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
  LUCIANA. With words that in an honest suit might move.
    First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
  ADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?
  LUCIANA. Have patience, I beseech.
  ADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;
    My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
    He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
    Ill-fac'd, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
    Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
    Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
  LUCIANA. Who would be jealous then of such a one?
    No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
  ADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,
    And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
    Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;
    My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

              Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the purse. Sweet
    now, make haste.
  LUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy breath?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By running fast.
  ADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
    A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
    One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
    A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
    A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
    A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
    The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;
    A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
    One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell.
  ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter; he is rested
      on the case.
  ADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
    But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
    Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
  ADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I wonder at:
    Thus he unknown to me should be in debt.
    Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. on a band, but on a stronger thing,
    A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?
  ADRIANA. What, the chain?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; 'tis time that I were gone.
    It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.
  ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes. If any hour meet a sergeant, 'a turns
      back for very fear.
  ADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes
      more than he's worth to season.
    Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
    That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
    If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
    Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

             Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse

  ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight,
    And bring thy master home immediately.
    Come, sister; I am press'd down with conceit-
    Conceit, my comfort and my injury.                         Exeunt
                        SCENE 3

                       The mart

              Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE

  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
    As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
    And every one doth call me by my name.
    Some tender money to me, some invite me,
    Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,
    Some offer me commodities to buy;
    Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop,
    And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
    And therewithal took measure of my body.
    Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,
    And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.

              Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me
    for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell'd?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou mean?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise,
    but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the
    calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind
    you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, 'tis a plain case: he that
    went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
    that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest
    them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give
    them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more
    exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean'st an officer?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;
    that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; on
    that thinks a man always going to bed, and says 'God give
    you good rest!'
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is
    there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I brought you word an
    hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and
    then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to tarry for the
    boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;
    And here we wander in illusions.
    Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

                      Enter a COURTEZAN

  COURTEZAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
    I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.
    Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistress Satan?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's
    dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and
    thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me!' That's
    as much to say 'God make me a light wench!' It is written
    they appear to men like angels of light; light is an effect
    of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn.
    Come not near her.
  COURTEZAN. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
    Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat,
    or bespeak a long spoon.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, he must have a long spoon
    that must eat with the devil.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell'st thou me of
      supping?
    Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;
    I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
  COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
    Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd,
    And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
    A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
    A nut, a cherry-stone;
    But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
    Master, be wise; an if you give it her,
    The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.
  COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain;
    I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly pride' says the peacock. Mistress,
      that you know.
                 Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
  COURTEZAN. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,
    Else would he never so demean himself.
    A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
    And for the same he promis'd me a chain;
    Both one and other he denies me now.
    The reason that I gather he is mad,
    Besides this present instance of his rage,
    Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner
    Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
    Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
    On purpose shut the doors against his way.
    My way is now to hie home to his house,
    And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
    He rush'd into my house and took perforce
    My ring away. This course I fittest choose,
    For forty ducats is too much to lose.                        Exit
                           SCENE 4

                          A street

         Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER

  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.
    I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
    To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
    My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
    And will not lightly trust the messenger.
    That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
    I tell you 'twill sound harshly in her cars.

          Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS, with a rope's-end

    Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
    How now, sir! Have you that I sent you for?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I
    return'd.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.
                                                        [Beating him]
  OFFICER. Good sir, be patient.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in
    adversity.
  OFFICER. Good now, hold thy tongue.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I would I were senseless, sir, that I
    might not feel your blows.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but
    blows, and so is an ass.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I am an ass indeed; you may prove it
    by my long 'ears. I have served him from the hour of my
    nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for
    my service but blows. When I am cold he heats me with
    beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am
    wak'd with it when I sleep; rais'd with it when I sit; driven
    out of doors with it when I go from home; welcom'd home
    with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as
    beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam'd me,
    I shall beg with it from door to door.

     Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and a SCHOOLMASTER
                      call'd PINCH

  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
    rather, to prophesy like the parrot, 'Beware the rope's-end.'
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?          [Beating him]
  COURTEZAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?
  ADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.
    Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer:
    Establish him in his true sense again,
    And I will please you what you will demand.
  LUCIANA. Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
  COURTEZAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.
  PINCH. Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
                                                       [Striking him]
  PINCH. I charge thee, Satan, hous'd within this man,
    To yield possession to my holy prayers,
    And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.
    I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
  ADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?
    Did this companion with the saffron face
    Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
    Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,
    And I denied to enter in my house?
  ADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din'd at home,
    Where would you had remain'd until this time,
    Free from these slanders and this open shame!
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din'd at home! Thou villain, what sayest
      thou?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, Sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she herself revil'd you there.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and
      scorn me?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My bones bear witness,
    That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
  ADRIANA. Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
  PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,
    And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest
      me.
  ADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
    By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and goodwill you might,
    But surely, master, not a rag of money.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went'st not thou to her for purse of ducats?
  ADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver'd it.
  LUCIANA. And I am witness with her that she did.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness
    That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
  PINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
    I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
    They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth
      to-day?
    And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
  ADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, gentle master, I receiv'd no gold;
    But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
  ADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
    And art confederate with a damned pack
    To make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
    But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
    That would behold in me this shameful sport.
  ADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.
  PINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him.

    Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives

  LUCIANA. Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
    I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them
    To make a rescue?
  OFFICER. Masters, let him go;
    He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
  PINCH. Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
                                                   [They bind DROMIO]
  ADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
    Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
    Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
  OFFICER. He is my prisoner; if I let him go,
    The debt he owes will be requir'd of me.
  ADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;
    Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
    And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
    Good Master Doctor, see him safe convey'd
    Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here ent'red in bond for you.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore
    dost thou mad me?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Will you be bound for nothing?
    Be mad, good master; cry 'The devil!'
  LUCIANA. God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
  ADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
             Exeunt all but ADRIANA, LUCIANA, OFFICERS, and COURTEZAN
    Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
  OFFICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?
  ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
  OFFICER. Two hundred ducats.
  ADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?
  OFFICER. Due for a chain your husband had of him.
  ADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
  COURTEZAN. When as your husband, all in rage, to-day
    Came to my house, and took away my ring-
    The ring I saw upon his finger now-
    Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
  ADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.
    Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is;
    I long to know the truth hereof at large.

  Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, with his rapier drawn, and
                  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.

  LUCIANA. God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
  ADRIANA. And come with naked swords.
    Let's call more help to have them bound again.
  OFFICER. Away, they'll kill us!
                     Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO
                              OF SYRACUSE as fast as may be, frighted
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. She that would be your wife now ran from you.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from
      thence.
    I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, stay here this night; they will
    surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us
    gold; methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
    the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me,
    could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I will not stay to-night for all the town;
    Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.                   Exeunt
                      ACT V. SCENE 1

                 A street before a priory

             Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO

  ANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind'red you;
    But I protest he had the chain of me,
    Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
  SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem'd here in the city?
  ANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,
    Of credit infinite, highly belov'd,
    Second to none that lives here in the city;
    His word might bear my wealth at any time.
  SECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

  ANGELO. 'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
    Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
    Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
    Signior Andpholus, I wonder much
    That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
    And, not without some scandal to yourself,
    With circumstance and oaths so to deny
    This chain, which now you wear so openly.
    Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
    You have done wrong to this my honest friend;
    Who, but for staying on our controversy,
    Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.
    This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.
  SECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
  SECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know'st, did hear thee.
    Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou liv'st
    To walk where any honest men resort.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;
    I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
    Against thee presently, if thou dar'st stand.
  SECOND MERCHANT. I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
                                                          [They draw]

       Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERS

  ADRIANA. Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! He is mad.
    Some get within him, take his sword away;
    Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Run, master, run; for God's sake take a house.
    This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd.
                 Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
                                                        to the priory

                   Enter the LADY ABBESS

  ABBESS. Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
  ADRIANA. To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
    Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,
    And bear him home for his recovery.
  ANGELO. I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
  SECOND MERCHANT. I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
  ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?
  ADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
    And much different from the man he was;
    But till this afternoon his passion
    Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
  ABBESS. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
    Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
    Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
    A sin prevailing much in youthful men
    Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
    Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
  ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;
    Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
  ABBESS. You should for that have reprehended him.
  ADRIANA. Why, so I did.
  ABBESS. Ay, but not rough enough.
  ADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.
  ABBESS. Haply in private.
  ADRIANA. And in assemblies too.
  ABBESS. Ay, but not enough.
  ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.
    In bed, he slept not for my urging it;
    At board, he fed not for my urging it;
    Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
    In company, I often glanced it;
    Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
  ABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad.
    The venom clamours of a jealous woman
    Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
    It seems his sleeps were hind'red by thy railing,
    And thereof comes it that his head is light.
    Thou say'st his meat was sauc'd with thy upbraidings:
    Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
    Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
    And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
    Thou say'st his sports were hind'red by thy brawls.
    Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
    But moody and dull melancholy,
    Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
    And at her heels a huge infectious troop
    Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
    In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,
    To be disturb'd would mad or man or beast.
    The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits
    Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits.
  LUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly,
    When he demean'd himself rough, rude, and wildly.
    Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?
  ADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.
    Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.
  ABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.
  ADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
  ABBESS. Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,
    And it shall privilege him from your hands
    Till I have brought him to his wits again,
    Or lose my labour in assaying it.
  ADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
    Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
    And will have no attorney but myself;
    And therefore let me have him home with me.
  ABBESS. Be patient; for I will not let him stir
    Till I have us'd the approved means I have,
    With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,
    To make of him a formal man again.
    It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
    A charitable duty of my order;
    Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.
  ADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;
    And ill it doth beseem your holiness
    To separate the husband and the wife.
  ABBESS. Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.         Exit
  LUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.
  ADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,
    And never rise until my tears and prayers
    Have won his Grace to come in person hither
    And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
  SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five;
    Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person
    Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
    The place of death and sorry execution,
    Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
  ANGELO. Upon what cause?
  SECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
    Who put unluckily into this bay
    Against the laws and statutes of this town,
    Beheaded publicly for his offence.
  ANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.
  LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.

    Enter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded; with the
               HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS

  DUKE. Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
    If any friend will pay the sum for him,
    He shall not die; so much we tender him.
  ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!
  DUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady;
    It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
  ADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,
    Who I made lord of me and all I had
    At your important letters-this ill day
    A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
    That desp'rately he hurried through the street,
    With him his bondman all as mad as he,
    Doing displeasure to the citizens
    By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
    Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.
    Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
    Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
    That here and there his fury had committed.
    Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
    He broke from those that had the guard of him,
    And with his mad attendant and himself,
    Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
    Met us again and, madly bent on us,
    Chas'd us away; till, raising of more aid,
    We came again to bind them. Then they fled
    Into this abbey, whither we pursu'd them;
    And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,
    And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
    Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
    Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command
    Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
  DUKE. Long since thy husband serv'd me in my wars,
    And I to thee engag'd a prince's word,
    When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
    To do him all the grace and good I could.
    Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,
    And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,
    I will determine this before I stir.

              Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
    My master and his man are both broke loose,
    Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,
    Whose beard they have sing'd off with brands of fire;
    And ever, as it blaz'd, they threw on him
    Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.
    My master preaches patience to him, and the while
    His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;
    And sure, unless you send some present help,
    Between them they will kill the conjurer.
  ADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
    And that is false thou dost report to us.
  MESSENGER. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
    I have not breath'd almost since I did see it.
    He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
    To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.           [Cry within]
    Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!
  DUKE. Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds.
  ADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you
    That he is borne about invisible.
    Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here,
    And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

      Enter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUS

  ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me
      justice!
    Even for the service that long since I did thee,
    When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
    Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
    That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
  AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
    I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.
  ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman
      there!
    She whom thou gav'st to me to be my wife,
    That hath abused and dishonoured me
    Even in the strength and height of injury.
    Beyond imagination is the wrong
    That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
  DUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
  ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors
      upon me,
    While she with harlots feasted in my house.
  DUKE. A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?
  ADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,
    To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
    As this is false he burdens me withal!
  LUCIANA. Ne'er may I look on day nor sleep on night
    But she tells to your Highness simple truth!
  ANGELO. O peflur'd woman! They are both forsworn.
    In this the madman justly chargeth them.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;
    Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
    Nor heady-rash, provok'd with raging ire,
    Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
    This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner;
    That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
    Could witness it, for he was with me then;
    Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
    Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
    Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
    Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
    I went to seek him. In the street I met him,
    And in his company that gentleman.
    There did this perjur'd goldsmith swear me down
    That I this day of him receiv'd the chain,
    Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
    He did arrest me with an officer.
    I did obey, and sent my peasant home
    For certain ducats; he with none return'd.
    Then fairly I bespoke the officer
    To go in person with me to my house.
    By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more
    Of vile confederates. Along with them
    They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac'd villain,
    A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
    A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,
    A needy, hollow-ey'd, sharp-looking wretch,
    A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
    Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
    And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
    And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
    Cries out I was possess'd. Then all together
    They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
    And in a dark and dankish vault at home
    There left me and my man, both bound together;
    Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
    I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
    Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech
    To give me ample satisfaction
    For these deep shames and great indignities.
  ANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
    That he din'd not at home, but was lock'd out.
  DUKE. But had he such a chain of thee, or no?
  ANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
    These people saw the chain about his neck.
  SECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
    Heard you confess you had the chain of him,
    After you first forswore it on the mart;
    And thereupon I drew my sword on you,
    And then you fled into this abbey here,
    From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,
    Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;
    I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
    And this is false you burden me withal.
  DUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
    I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
    If here you hous'd him, here he would have been;
    If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
    You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here
    Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine.
  COURTEZAN. He did; and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. 'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
  DUKE. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
  COURTEZAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.
  DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the Abbess hither.
    I think you are all mated or stark mad.
                                               Exit one to the ABBESS
  AEGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
    Haply I see a friend will save my life
    And pay the sum that may deliver me.
  DUKE. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
  AEGEON. Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
    And is not that your bondman Dromio?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
    But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords
    Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
  AEGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
    For lately we were bound as you are now.
    You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
  AEGEON. Why look you strange on me? You know me well.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.
  AEGEON. O! grief hath chang'd me since you saw me last;
    And careful hours with time's deformed hand
    Have written strange defeatures in my face.
    But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.
  AEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, trust me, sir, nor I.
  AEGEON. I am sure thou dost.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and
    whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
  AEGEON. Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
    Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
    In seven short years that here my only son
    Knows not my feeble key of untun'd cares?
    Though now this grained face of mine be hid
    In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
    And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
    Yet hath my night of life some memory,
    My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
    My dull deaf ears a little use to hear;
    All these old witnesses-I cannot err-
    Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.
  AEGEON. But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,
    Thou know'st we parted; but perhaps, my son,
    Thou sham'st to acknowledge me in misery.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in
    the city Can witness with me that it is not so:
    I ne'er saw Syracuse in my life.
  DUKE. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
    Have I been patron to Antipholus,
    During which time he ne'er saw Syracuse.
    I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

    Re-enter the ABBESS, with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and
                  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

  ABBESS. Most mighty Duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
                                             [All gather to see them]
  ADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
  DUKE. One of these men is genius to the other;
    And so of these. Which is the natural man,
    And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I, Sir, am Dromio; pray let me stay.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, my old master! who hath bound
  ABBESS. Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,
    And gain a husband by his liberty.
    Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man
    That hadst a wife once call'd Aemilia,
    That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.
    O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak,
    And speak unto the same Aemilia!
  AEGEON. If I dream not, thou art Aemilia.
    If thou art she, tell me where is that son
    That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
  ABBESS. By men of Epidamnum he and I
    And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;
    But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
    By force took Dromio and my son from them,
    And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
    What then became of them I cannot tell;
    I to this fortune that you see me in.
  DUKE. Why, here begins his morning story right.
    These two Antipholus', these two so like,
    And these two Dromios, one in semblance-
    Besides her urging of her wreck at sea-
    These are the parents to these children,
    Which accidentally are met together.
    Antipholus, thou cam'st from Corinth first?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
  DUKE. Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. And I with him.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous
      warrior,
    Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
  ADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.
  ADRIANA. And are not you my husband?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;
    And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
    Did call me brother.  [To LUCIANA]  What I told you then,
    I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
    If this be not a dream I see and hear.
  ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
  ANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
  ADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
    By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, none by me.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv'd from you,
    And Dromio my man did bring them me.
    I see we still did meet each other's man,
    And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
    And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.
  DUKE. It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
  COURTEZAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my
    good cheer.
  ABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
    To go with us into the abbey here,
    And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
    And all that are assembled in this place
    That by this sympathized one day's error
    Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
    And we shall make full satisfaction.
    Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
    Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
    My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
    The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
    And you the calendars of their nativity,
    Go to a gossips' feast, and go with me;
    After so long grief, such nativity!
  DUKE. With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
                 Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, ANTIPHOLUS OF
                   EPHESUS, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
  ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou
      embark'd?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the
      Centaur.
  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.
    Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon.
    Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
              Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There is a fat friend at your master's house,
    That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner;
    She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother;
    I see by you I am a sweet-fac'd youth.
    Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not I, sir; you are my elder.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. That's a question; how shall we try it?
  DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. We'll draw cuts for the senior; till then, lead
      thou first.
  DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, then, thus:
    We came into the world like brother and brother,
    And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
                                                               Exeunt

ACT1|SC1
                          ACT I. SCENE 1.

                          London. A street
             Enter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus

  GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent
    Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
    And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
    Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,
    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
    Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
    He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
    But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
    Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-
    I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph-
    I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
    Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
    Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
    And that so lamely and unfashionable
    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-
    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
    Have no delight to pass away the time,
    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
    And descant on mine own deformity.
    And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
    To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
    I am determined to prove a villain
    And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
    Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
    By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
    To set my brother Clarence and the King
    In deadly hate the one against the other;
    And if King Edward be as true and just
    As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
    This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up-
    About a prophecy which says that G
    Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
    Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.

             Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY

    Brother, good day. What means this armed guard
    That waits upon your Grace?
  CLARENCE. His Majesty,
    Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed
    This conduct to convey me to th' Tower.
  GLOUCESTER. Upon what cause?
  CLARENCE. Because my name is George.
  GLOUCESTER. Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
    He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
    O, belike his Majesty hath some intent
    That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower.
    But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?
  CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
    As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,
    He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
    And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
    And says a wizard told him that by G
    His issue disinherited should be;
    And, for my name of George begins with G,
    It follows in his thought that I am he.
    These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
    Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now.
  GLOUCESTER. Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:
    'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
    My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
    That tempers him to this extremity.
    Was it not she and that good man of worship,
    Antony Woodville, her brother there,
    That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
    From whence this present day he is delivered?
    We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
  CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
    But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds
    That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.
    Heard you not what an humble suppliant
    Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?
  GLOUCESTER. Humbly complaining to her deity
    Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
    I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,
    If we will keep in favour with the King,
    To be her men and wear her livery:
    The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,
    Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
    Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
  BRAKENBURY. I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
    His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
    That no man shall have private conference,
    Of what degree soever, with your brother.
  GLOUCESTER. Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
    You may partake of any thing we say:
    We speak no treason, man; we say the King
    Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
    Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
    We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
    A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
    And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
    How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
  BRAKENBURY. With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
  GLOUCESTER. Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,
    fellow,
    He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
    Were best to do it secretly alone.
  BRAKENBURY. What one, my lord?
  GLOUCESTER. Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?
  BRAKENBURY. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and
    withal
    Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.
  CLARENCE. We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
    obey.
  GLOUCESTER. We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.
    Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;
    And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-
    Were it to call King Edward's widow sister-
    I will perform it to enfranchise you.
    Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
    Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
  CLARENCE. I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
  GLOUCESTER. Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
    I will deliver or else lie for you.
    Meantime, have patience.
  CLARENCE. I must perforce. Farewell.
                          Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard
  GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
    Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
    That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
    If heaven will take the present at our hands.
    But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?

                       Enter LORD HASTINGS

  HASTINGS. Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
  GLOUCESTER. As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!
    Well are you welcome to the open air.
    How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
  HASTINGS. With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;
    But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
    That were the cause of my imprisonment.
  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
    For they that were your enemies are his,
    And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
  HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew'd
    Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
  GLOUCESTER. What news abroad?
  HASTINGS. No news so bad abroad as this at home:
    The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
    And his physicians fear him mightily.
  GLOUCESTER. Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
    O, he hath kept an evil diet long
    And overmuch consum'd his royal person!
    'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
    Where is he? In his bed?
  HASTINGS. He is.
  GLOUCESTER. Go you before, and I will follow you.
                                                   Exit HASTINGS
    He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
    Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.
    I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
    With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
    And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
    Clarence hath not another day to live;
    Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
    And leave the world for me to bustle in!
    For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
    What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
    The readiest way to make the wench amends
    Is to become her husband and her father;
    The which will I-not all so much for love
    As for another secret close intent
    By marrying her which I must reach unto.
    But yet I run before my horse to market.
    Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns;
    When they are gone, then must I count my gains.         Exit


ACT1|SC2
                             SCENE 2.

                      London. Another street
            Enter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH, with
            halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the
            mourner, attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY

  ANNE. Set down, set down your honourable load-
    If honour may be shrouded in a hearse;
    Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
    Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
    Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
    Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
    Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
    Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
    To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
    Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,
    Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds.
    Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
    I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
    O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!
    Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!
    Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
    More direful hap betide that hated wretch
    That makes us wretched by the death of thee
    Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
    Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
    If ever he have child, abortive be it,
    Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
    Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
    May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
    And that be heir to his unhappiness!
    If ever he have wife, let her be made
    More miserable by the death of him
    Than I am made by my young lord and thee!
    Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
    Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
    And still as you are weary of this weight
    Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
                                [The bearers take up the coffin]

                      Enter GLOUCESTER

  GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
  ANNE. What black magician conjures up this fiend
    To stop devoted charitable deeds?
  GLOUCESTER. Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
    I'll make a corse of him that disobeys!
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the coffin
    pass.
  GLOUCESTER. Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command.
    Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
    Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot
    And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
                               [The bearers set down the coffin]
  ANNE. What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
    Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
    And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
    Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
    Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
    His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.
  GLOUCESTER. Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
  ANNE. Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;
    For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
    Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
    If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
    Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
    O, gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry's wounds
    Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh.
    Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
    For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
    From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;
    Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
    Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
    O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!
    O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!
    Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;
    Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
    As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
    Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.
  GLOUCESTER. Lady, you know no rules of charity,
    Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
  ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
    No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
  GLOUCESTER. But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
  ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
  GLOUCESTER. More wonderful when angels are so angry.
    Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
    Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
    By circumstance but to acquit myself.
  ANNE. Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
    Of these known evils but to give me leave
    By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.
  GLOUCESTER. Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
    Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
  ANNE. Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
    No excuse current but to hang thyself.
  GLOUCESTER. By such despair I should accuse myself.
  ANNE. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
    For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
    That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
  GLOUCESTER. Say that I slew them not?
  ANNE. Then say they were not slain.
    But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.
  GLOUCESTER. I did not kill your husband.
  ANNE. Why, then he is alive.
  GLOUCESTER. Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.
  ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
    Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood;
    The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
    But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
  GLOUCESTER. I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue
    That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
  ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
    That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.
    Didst thou not kill this king?
  GLOUCESTER. I grant ye.
  ANNE. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to
    Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
    O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
  GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath
    him.
  ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
  GLOUCESTER. Let him thank me that holp to send him
    thither,
    For he was fitter for that place than earth.
  ANNE. And thou unfit for any place but hell.
  GLOUCESTER. Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
  ANNE. Some dungeon.
  GLOUCESTER. Your bed-chamber.
  ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
  GLOUCESTER. So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
  ANNE. I hope so.
  GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
    To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
    And fall something into a slower method-
    Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
    Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
    As blameful as the executioner?
  ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
  GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect-
    Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
    To undertake the death of all the world
    So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
  ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
    These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
  GLOUCESTER. These eyes could not endure that beauty's
    wreck;
    You should not blemish it if I stood by.
    As all the world is cheered by the sun,
    So I by that; it is my day, my life.
  ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
  GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
  ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
  GLOUCESTER. It is a quarrel most unnatural,
    To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
  ANNE. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
    To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.
  GLOUCESTER. He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband
    Did it to help thee to a better husband.
  ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
  GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves thee better than he could.
  ANNE. Name him.
  GLOUCESTER. Plantagenet.
  ANNE. Why, that was he.
  GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature.
  ANNE. Where is he?
  GLOUCESTER. Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit
    at me?
  ANNE. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
  GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.
  ANNE. Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
    Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.
  GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
  ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
  GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;
    For now they kill me with a living death.
    Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
    Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-
    These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
    No, when my father York and Edward wept
    To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
    When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
    Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
    Told the sad story of my father's death,
    And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
    That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
    Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time
    My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
    And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
    Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
    I never sued to friend nor enemy;
    My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
    But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,
    My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
                                   [She looks scornfully at him]
    Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made
    For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
    If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
    Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
    Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
    And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
    I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
    And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
      [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]
    Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-
    But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
    Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward-
    But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
                                           [She falls the sword]
    Take up the sword again, or take up me.
  ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,
    I will not be thy executioner.
  GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
  ANNE. I have already.
  GLOUCESTER. That was in thy rage.
    Speak it again, and even with the word
    This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
    Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
    To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
  ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.
  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
  ANNE. I fear me both are false.
  GLOUCESTER. Then never was man true.
  ANNE. well put up your sword.
  GLOUCESTER. Say, then, my peace is made.
  ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.
  GLOUCESTER. But shall I live in hope?
  ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.
  GLOUCESTER. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
  ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]
  GLOUCESTER. Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
    Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
    Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
    And if thy poor devoted servant may
    But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
    Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
  ANNE. What is it?
  GLOUCESTER. That it may please you leave these sad designs
    To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
    And presently repair to Crosby House;
    Where-after I have solemnly interr'd
    At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king,
    And wet his grave with my repentant tears-
    I will with all expedient duty see you.
    For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
    Grant me this boon.
  ANNE. With all my heart; and much it joys me too
    To see you are become so penitent.
    Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
  GLOUCESTER. Bid me farewell.
  ANNE. 'Tis more than you deserve;
    But since you teach me how to flatter you,
    Imagine I have said farewell already.
                             Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY ANNE
  GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse.
  GENTLEMEN. Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
  GLOUCESTER. No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.
                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
    Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
    Was ever woman in this humour won?
    I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
    What! I that kill'd her husband and his father-
    To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
    With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
    The bleeding witness of my hatred by;
    Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
    And I no friends to back my suit at all
    But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
    And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
    Ha!
    Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
    Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
    Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
    A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
    Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,
    Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-
    The spacious world cannot again afford;
    And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
    That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
    And made her widow to a woeful bed?
    On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
    On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
    My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
    I do mistake my person all this while.
    Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
    Myself to be a marv'llous proper man.
    I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
    And entertain a score or two of tailors
    To study fashions to adorn my body.
    Since I am crept in favour with myself,
    I will maintain it with some little cost.
    But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
    And then return lamenting to my love.
    Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
    That I may see my shadow as I pass.                     Exit


ACT1|SC3
                            SCENE 3.

                       London. The palace
               Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, LORD RIVERS,
                         and LORD GREY

  RIVERS. Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty
    Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
  GREY. In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
    Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
    And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. If he were dead, what would betide on
    me?
  GREY. No other harm but loss of such a lord.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all
    harms.
  GREY. The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
    To be your comforter when he is gone.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, he is young; and his minority
    Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
    A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
  RIVER. Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. It is determin'd, not concluded yet;
    But so it must be, if the King miscarry.

                     Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY

  GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.
  BUCKINGHAM. Good time of day unto your royal Grace!
  DERBY. God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Countess Richmond, good my Lord
    of Derby,
    To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
    Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife
    And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
    I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
  DERBY. I do beseech you, either not believe
    The envious slanders of her false accusers;
    Or, if she be accus'd on true report,
    Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
    From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of
    Derby?
  DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
    Are come from visiting his Majesty.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What likelihood of his amendment,
    Lords?
  BUCKINGHAM. Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks
    cheerfully.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God grant him health! Did you confer
    with him?
  BUCKINGHAM. Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement
    Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
    And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;
    And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Would all were well! But that will
    never be.
    I fear our happiness is at the height.

              Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET

  GLOUCESTER. They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.
    Who is it that complains unto the King
    That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
    By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
    That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
    Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
    Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
    Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
    I must be held a rancorous enemy.
    Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
    But thus his simple truth must be abus'd
    With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
  GREY. To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
  GLOUCESTER. To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
    When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong,
    Or thee, or thee, or any of your faction?
    A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
    Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-
    Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while
    But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the
    matter.
    The King, on his own royal disposition
    And not provok'd by any suitor else-
    Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred
    That in your outward action shows itself
    Against my children, brothers, and myself-
    Makes him to send that he may learn the ground.
  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad
    That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
    Since every Jack became a gentleman,
    There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, we know your meaning,
    brother Gloucester:
    You envy my advancement and my friends';
    God grant we never may have need of you!
  GLOUCESTER. Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.
    Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
    Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility
    Held in contempt; while great promotions
    Are daily given to ennoble those
    That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By Him that rais'd me to this careful
    height
    From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
    I never did incense his Majesty
    Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
    An earnest advocate to plead for him.
    My lord, you do me shameful injury
    Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
  GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean
    Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
  RIVERS. She may, my lord; for-
  GLOUCESTER. She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows
    not so?
    She may do more, sir, than denying that:
    She may help you to many fair preferments
    And then deny her aiding hand therein,
    And lay those honours on your high desert.
    What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-
  RIVERS. What, marry, may she?
  GLOUCESTER. What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
    A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
    Iwis your grandam had a worser match.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long
    borne
    Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
    By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
    Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.
    I had rather be a country servant-maid
    Than a great queen with this condition-
    To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at.

                Enter old QUEEN MARGARET, behind

    Small joy have I in being England's Queen.
  QUEEN MARGARET. And less'ned be that small, God, I
    beseech Him!
    Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.
  GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with telling of the
    King?
    Tell him and spare not. Look what I have said
    I will avouch't in presence of the King.
    I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r.
    'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Out, devil! I do remember them to
    well:
    Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,
    And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
  GLOUCESTER. Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband
    King,
    I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,
    A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
    A liberal rewarder of his friends;
    To royalize his blood I spent mine own.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, and much better blood than his or
    thine.
  GLOUCESTER. In all which time you and your husband Grey
    Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
    And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
    In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain?
    Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
    What you have been ere this, and what you are;
    Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
  QUEEN MARGARET. A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
  GLOUCESTER. Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,
    Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!-
  QUEEN MARGARET. Which God revenge!
  GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
    And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
    I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's,
    Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.
    I am too childish-foolish for this world.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
    world,
    Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is.
  RIVERS. My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
    Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
    We follow'd then our lord, our sovereign king.
    So should we you, if you should be our king.
  GLOUCESTER. If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar.
    Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
    You should enjoy were you this country's king,
    As little joy you may suppose in me
    That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.
  QUEEN MARGARET. As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;
    For I am she, and altogether joyless.
    I can no longer hold me patient.                 [Advancing]
    Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
    In sharing that which you have pill'd from me.
    Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
    If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,
    Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?
    Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!
  GLOUCESTER. Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my
    sight?
  QUEEN MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
    That will I make before I let thee go.
  GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
  QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in
    banishment
    Than death can yield me here by my abode.
    A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
    And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.
    This sorrow that I have by right is yours;
    And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
  GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee,
    When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
    And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
    And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout
    Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-
    His curses then from bitterness of soul
    Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee;
    And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent.
  HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
    And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
  RIVERS. Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
  DORSET. No man but prophesied revenge for it.
  BUCKINGHAM. Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
  QUEEN MARGARET. What, were you snarling all before I came,
    Ready to catch each other by the throat,
    And turn you all your hatred now on me?
    Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
    That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
    Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
    Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
    Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
    Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
    Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,
    As ours by murder, to make him a king!
    Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,
    For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,
    Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
    Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
    Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
    Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,
    And see another, as I see thee now,
    Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
    Long die thy happy days before thy death;
    And, after many length'ned hours of grief,
    Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!
    Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
    And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
    Was stabb'd with bloody daggers. God, I pray him,
    That none of you may live his natural age,
    But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
  GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd
    hag.
  QUEEN MARGARET. And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou
    shalt hear me.
    If heaven have any grievous plague in store
    Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
    O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
    And then hurl down their indignation
    On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
    The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul!
    Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,
    And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
    No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
    Unless it be while some tormenting dream
    Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
    Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog,
    Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
    The slave of nature and the son of hell,
    Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb,
    Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins,
    Thou rag of honour, thou detested-
  GLOUCESTER. Margaret!
  QUEEN MARGARET. Richard!
  GLOUCESTER. Ha?
  QUEEN MARGARET. I call thee not.
  GLOUCESTER. I cry thee mercy then, for I did think
    That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.
    O, let me make the period to my curse!
  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thus have you breath'd your curse
    against yourself.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my
    fortune!
    Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
    Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
    Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
    The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
    To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad.
  HASTINGS. False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
    Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Foul shame upon you! you have all
    mov'd mine.
  RIVERS. Were you well serv'd, you would be taught your
      duty.
  QUEEN MARGARET. To serve me well you all should do me
    duty,
    Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects.
    O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
  DORSET. Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert;
    Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
    O, that your young nobility could judge
    What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!
    They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
    And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.
  GLOUCESTER. Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.
  DORSET. It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
  GLOUCESTER. Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,
    Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
    And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.
  QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!
    Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
    Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
    Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
    Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
    O God that seest it, do not suffer it;
    As it is won with blood, lost be it so!
  BUCKINGHAM. Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!
  QUEEN MARGARET. Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
    Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
    And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.
    My charity is outrage, life my shame;
    And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!
  BUCKINGHAM. Have done, have done.
  QUEEN MARGARET. O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy
    hand
    In sign of league and amity with thee.
    Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
    Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
    Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
  BUCKINGHAM. Nor no one here; for curses never pass
    The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
  QUEEN MARGARET. I will not think but they ascend the sky
    And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
    O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
    Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
    His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
    Have not to do with him, beware of him;
    Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,
    And all their ministers attend on him.
  GLOUCESTER. What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
  BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
  QUEEN MARGARET. What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle
    counsel,
    And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
    O, but remember this another day,
    When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
    And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
    Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
    And he to yours, and all of you to God's!               Exit
  BUCKINGHAM. My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
  RIVERS. And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.
  GLOUCESTER. I cannot blame her; by God's holy Mother,
    She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
    My part thereof that I have done to her.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I never did her any to my knowledge.
  GLOUCESTER. Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
    I was too hot to do somebody good
    That is too cold in thinking of it now.
    Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;
    He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains;
    God pardon them that are the cause thereof!
  RIVERS. A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
    To pray for them that have done scathe to us!
  GLOUCESTER. So do I ever-  [Aside]  being well advis'd;
    For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself.

                         Enter CATESBY

  CATESBY. Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,
    And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go
    with me?
  RIVERS. We wait upon your Grace.
                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
  GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
    The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
    I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
    Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,
    I do beweep to many simple gulls;
    Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;
    And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies
    That stir the King against the Duke my brother.
    Now they believe it, and withal whet me
    To be reveng'd on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;
    But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture,
    Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.
    And thus I clothe my naked villainy
    With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ,
    And seem a saint when most I play the devil.

                       Enter two MURDERERS

    But, soft, here come my executioners.
    How now, my hardy stout resolved mates!
    Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
  FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the
    warrant,
    That we may be admitted where he is.
  GLOUCESTER. Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
                                             [Gives the warrant]
    When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
    But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
    Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
    For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
    May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.
  FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
    prate;
    Talkers are no good doers. Be assur'd
    We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
  GLOUCESTER. Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall
    tears.
    I like you, lads; about your business straight;
    Go, go, dispatch.
  FIRST MURDERER. We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt


ACT1|SC4
                            SCENE 4.

                        London. The Tower
                    Enter CLARENCE and KEEPER

  KEEPER. Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
  CLARENCE. O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
    So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
    That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
    I would not spend another such a night
    Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days-
    So full of dismal terror was the time!
  KEEPER. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
    tell me.
  CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
    And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
    And in my company my brother Gloucester,
    Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
    Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,
    And cited up a thousand heavy times,
    During the wars of York and Lancaster,
    That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
    Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
    Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
    Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard
    Into the tumbling billows of the main.
    O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
    What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
    What sights of ugly death within my eyes!
    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
    A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
    All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
    Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes
    Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,
    As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
    That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
    And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.
  KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death
    To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
  CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive
    To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood
    Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth
    To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air;
    But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
    Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
  KEEPER. Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
  CLARENCE. No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life.
    O, then began the tempest to my soul!
    I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood
    With that sour ferryman which poets write of,
    Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
    The first that there did greet my stranger soul
    Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
    Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury
    Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
    And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by
    A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
    Dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud
    'Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,
    That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury.
    Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!'
    With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
    Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
    Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,
    I trembling wak'd, and for a season after
    Could not believe but that I was in hell,
    Such terrible impression made my dream.
  KEEPER. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
    I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
  CLARENCE. Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things
    That now give evidence against my soul
    For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!
    O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,
    But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,
    Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone;
    O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
  KEEPER, I prithee sit by me awhile;
    My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
  KEEPER. I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
                                               [CLARENCE sleeps]

                  Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant

  BRAKENBURY. Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
    Makes the night morning and the noontide night.
    Princes have but their titles for their glories,
    An outward honour for an inward toil;
    And for unfelt imaginations
    They often feel a world of restless cares,
    So that between their tides and low name
    There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

                      Enter the two MURDERERS

  FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who's here?
  BRAKENBURY. What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st
    thou hither?
  FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came
    hither on my legs.
  BRAKENBURY. What, so brief?
  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let
    him see our commission and talk no more.
                                           [BRAKENBURY reads it]
  BRAKENBURY. I am, in this, commanded to deliver
    The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
    I will not reason what is meant hereby,
    Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
    There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.
    I'll to the King and signify to him
    That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.
  FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare
    you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
  SECOND MURDERER. What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
  FIRST MURDERER. No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when
    he wakes.
  SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great
    judgment-day.
  FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
    sleeping.
  SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath
    bred a kind of remorse in me.
  FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid?
  SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to
    be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can
    defend me.
  FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.
  SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live.
  FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and
    tell him so.
  SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this
    passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to
    hold me but while one tells twenty.
  FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou feel thyself now?
    SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
    are yet within me.
  FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's
    done.
  SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
  FIRST MURDERER. Where's thy conscience now?
  SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!
  FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our
    reward, thy conscience flies out.
  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
    none will entertain it.
  FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to thee again?
  SECOND MURDERER. I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man
    coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man
    cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his
    neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-
    fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man
    full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
    that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.
    It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;
    and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
    to himself and live without it.
  FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
    persuading me not to kill the Duke.
  SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe
    him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the
    sigh.
  FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
    me.
  SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
    reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
  FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of
    thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the
    next room.
  SECOND MURDERER. O excellent device! and make a sop of
    him.
  FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes.
  SECOND MURDERER. Strike!
  FIRST MURDERER. No, we'll reason with him.
  CLARENCE. Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
  SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,
    anon.
  CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou?
  FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are.
  CLARENCE. But not as I am, royal.
  SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.
  CLARENCE. Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
  FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks
    mine own.
  CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
    Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?
    Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
  SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to-
  CLARENCE. To murder me?
  BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay.
  CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
    And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
    Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
  FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King.
  CLARENCE. I shall be reconcil'd to him again.
  SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
  CLARENCE. Are you drawn forth among a world of men
    To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
    Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
    What lawful quest have given their verdict up
    Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd
    The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
    Before I be convict by course of law,
    To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
    I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
    By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
    That you depart and lay no hands on me.
    The deed you undertake is damnable.
  FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.
  SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath commanded is our
    King.
  CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings
    Hath in the tables of his law commanded
    That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then
    Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
    Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand
    To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
  SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl
    on thee
    For false forswearing, and for murder too;
    Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
    In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
  FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God
    Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
    Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.
  SECOND MURDERER. Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
    defend.
  FIRST MURDERER. How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
    to us,
    When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
  CLARENCE. Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
    For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
    He sends you not to murder me for this,
    For in that sin he is as deep as I.
    If God will be avenged for the deed,
    O, know you yet He doth it publicly.
    Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm;
    He needs no indirect or lawless course
    To cut off those that have offended Him.
  FIRST MURDERER. Who made thee then a bloody minister
    When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
    That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
  CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
  FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
    faults,
    Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
  CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me;
    I am his brother, and I love him well.
    If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,
    And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
    Who shall reward you better for my life
    Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
  SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
    hates you.
  CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
    Go you to him from me.
  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we will.
  CLARENCE. Tell him when that our princely father York
    Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
    And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
    He little thought of this divided friendship.
    Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
  CLARENCE. O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
  FIRST MURDERER. Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you
    deceive yourself:
    'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
    CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune
    And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs
    That he would labour my delivery.
  FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
    From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
  SECOND MURDERER. Make peace with God, for you must die,
    my lord.
  CLARENCE. Have you that holy feeling in your souls
    To counsel me to make my peace with God,
    And are you yet to your own souls so blind
    That you will war with God by murd'ring me?
    O, sirs, consider: they that set you on
    To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
  SECOND MURDERER. What shall we do?
  CLARENCE. Relent, and save your souls.
  FIRST MURDERER. Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
  CLARENCE. Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
    Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
    Being pent from liberty as I am now,
    If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
    Would not entreat for life?
    My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;
    O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
    Come thou on my side and entreat for me-
    As you would beg were you in my distress.
    A begging prince what beggar pities not?
  SECOND MURDERER. Look behind you, my lord.
  FIRST MURDERER.  [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all
    this will not do,
    I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
                                              Exit with the body
  SECOND MURDERER. A bloody deed, and desperately
    dispatch'd!
    How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
    Of this most grievous murder!

                       Re-enter FIRST MURDERER

  FIRST MURDERER-How now, what mean'st thou that thou
    help'st me not?
    By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have
    been!
  SECOND MURDERER. I would he knew that I had sav'd his
    brother!
    Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
    For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit
  FIRST MURDERER. So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
    Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,
    Till that the Duke give order for his burial;
    And when I have my meed, I will away;
    For this will out, and then I must not stay.            Exit


ACT2|SC1
                          ACT II. SCENE 1.

                         London. The palace
                    Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD sick,
               QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS,
                     BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others

  KING EDWARD. Why, so. Now have I done a good day's
    work.
    You peers, continue this united league.
    I every day expect an embassage
    From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
    And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven,
    Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.
    Hastings and Rivers, take each other's hand;
    Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
  RIVERS. By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;
    And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
  HASTINGS. So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  KING EDWARD. Take heed you dally not before your king;
    Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
    Confound your hidden falsehood and award
    Either of you to be the other's end.
  HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
  RIVERS. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
  KING EDWARD. Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;
    Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you:
    You have been factious one against the other.
    Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
    And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There, Hastings; I will never more
    remember
    Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
  KING EDWARD. Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord
    Marquis.
  DORSET. This interchange of love, I here protest,
    Upon my part shall be inviolable.
  HASTINGS. And so swear I.                       [They embrace]
  KING EDWARD. Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this
    league
    With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
    And make me happy in your unity.
  BUCKINGHAM.  [To the QUEEN]  Whenever Buckingham
    doth turn his hate
    Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
    Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
    With hate in those where I expect most love!
    When I have most need to employ a friend
    And most assured that he is a friend,
    Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
    Be he unto me! This do I beg of God
    When I am cold in love to you or yours.
                                                  [They embrace]
  KING EDWARD. A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
    Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
    There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
    To make the blessed period of this peace.
  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time,
    Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke.

                      Enter GLOUCESTER, and RATCLIFF

  GLOUCESTER. Good morrow to my sovereign king and
    Queen;
    And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
  KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
    Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
    Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
    Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
  GLOUCESTER. A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.
    Among this princely heap, if any here,
    By false intelligence or wrong surmise,
    Hold me a foe-
    If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
    Have aught committed that is hardly borne
    To any in this presence, I desire
    To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
    'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
    I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
    First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
    Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
    Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
    If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;
    Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,
    That all without desert have frown'd on me;
    Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;
    Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all.
    I do not know that Englishman alive
    With whom my soul is any jot at odds
    More than the infant that is born to-night.
    I thank my God for my humility.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
    I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
    My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
    To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
  GLOUCESTER. Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,
    To be so flouted in this royal presence?
    Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead?
                                                [They all start]
    You do him injury to scorn his corse.
  KING EDWARD. Who knows not he is dead! Who knows
    he is?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
  BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
  DORSET. Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence
    But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
  KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.
  GLOUCESTER. But he, poor man, by your first order died,
    And that a winged Mercury did bear;
    Some tardy cripple bare the countermand
    That came too lag to see him buried.
    God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
    Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,
    Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
    And yet go current from suspicion!

                           Enter DERBY

  DERBY. A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
  KING EDWARD. I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.
  DERBY. I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
  KING EDWARD. Then say at once what is it thou requests.
  DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
    Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
    Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
  KING EDWARD. Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
    And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
    My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,
    And yet his punishment was bitter death.
    Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
    Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?
    Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
    Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
    The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
    Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury
    When Oxford had me down, he rescued me
    And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?
    Who told me, when we both lay in the field
    Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
    Even in his garments, and did give himself,
    All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
    All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
    Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
    Had so much race to put it in my mind.
    But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
    Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd
    The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
    You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
    And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.        [DERBY rises]
    But for my brother not a man would speak;
    Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
    For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
    Have been beholding to him in his life;
    Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
    O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
    On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!
    Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!
                                 Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN
  GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not
    How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
    Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
    O, they did urge it still unto the King!
    God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
    To comfort Edward with our company?
  BUCKINGHAM. We wait upon your Grace.                    Exeunt


ACT2|SC2
                              SCENE 2.

                         London. The palace
            Enter the old DUCHESS OF YORK, with the SON
                      and DAUGHTER of CLARENCE

  SON. Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
  DUCHESS. No, boy.
  DAUGHTER. Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
    And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'?
  SON. Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
    And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
    If that our noble father were alive?
  DUCHESS. My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
    I do lament the sickness of the King,
    As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
    It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
  SON. Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
    The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
    God will revenge it; whom I will importune
    With earnest prayers all to that effect.
  DAUGHTER. And so will I.
  DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you
    well.
    Incapable and shallow innocents,
    You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.
  SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
    Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen,
    Devis'd impeachments to imprison him.
    And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
    And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
    Bade me rely on him as on my father,
    And he would love me dearly as a child.
  DUCHESS. Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,
    And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!
    He is my son; ay, and therein my shame;
    Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
  SON. Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
  DUCHESS. Ay, boy.
  SON. I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?

            Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her
                ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her

  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and
    weep,
    To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
    I'll join with black despair against my soul
    And to myself become an enemy.
  DUCHESS. What means this scene of rude impatience?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To make an act of tragic violence.
  EDWARD, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.
    Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
    Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
    If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
    That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's,
    Or like obedient subjects follow him
    To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
  DUCHESS. Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
    As I had title in thy noble husband!
    I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
    And liv'd with looking on his images;
    But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
    Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
    And I for comfort have but one false glass,
    That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
    Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother
    And hast the comfort of thy children left;
    But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
    And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands-
    Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-
    Thine being but a moiety of my moan-
    To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?
  SON. Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
    How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
  DAUGHTER. Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
    Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Give me no help in lamentation;
    I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
    All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
    That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
    May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
    Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!
  CHILDREN. Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!
  DUCHESS. Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What stay had I but Edward? and he's
    gone.
  CHILDREN. What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
  DUCHESS. What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Was never widow had so dear a loss.
  CHILDREN. Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
  DUCHESS. Was never mother had so dear a loss.
    Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
    Their woes are parcell'd, mine is general.
    She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:
    I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.
    These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:
    I for an Edward weep, so do not they.
    Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
    Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
    And I will pamper it with lamentation.
  DORSET. Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd
    That you take with unthankfulness his doing.
    In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful
    With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
    Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
    Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
    For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
  RIVERS. Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
    Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him;
    Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives.
    Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
    And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.

               Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY,
                      HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF

  GLOUCESTER. Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
    To wail the dimming of our shining star;
    But none can help our harms by wailing them.
    Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
    I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee
    I crave your blessing.
  DUCHESS. God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,
    Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
  GLOUCESTER. Amen!  [Aside]  And make me die a good old
    man!
    That is the butt end of a mother's blessing;
    I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.
  BUCKINGHAM. You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing
    peers,
    That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
    Now cheer each other in each other's love.
    Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
    We are to reap the harvest of his son.
    The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts,
    But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
    Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept.
    Me seemeth good that, with some little train,
    Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
    Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.

 RIVERS. Why with some little train, my Lord of
    Buckingham?
  BUCKINGHAM. Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude
    The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
    Which would be so much the more dangerous
    By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd;
    Where every horse bears his commanding rein
    And may direct his course as please himself,
    As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,
    In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
  GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us;
    And the compact is firm and true in me.
  RIVERS. And so in me; and so, I think, in an.
    Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
    To no apparent likelihood of breach,
    Which haply by much company might be urg'd;
    Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
    That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.
  HASTINGS. And so say I.
  GLOUCESTER. Then be it so; and go we to determine
    Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
    Madam, and you, my sister, will you go
    To give your censures in this business?
                        Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
    For God sake, let not us two stay at home;
    For by the way I'll sort occasion,
    As index to the story we late talk'd of,
    To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince.
  GLOUCESTER. My other self, my counsel's consistory,
    My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,
    I, as a child, will go by thy direction.
    Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.        Exeunt


ACT2|SC3
                               SCENE 3.

                           London. A street
                 Enter one CITIZEN at one door, and
                         another at the other

  FIRST CITIZEN. Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so
    fast?
  SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
    Hear you the news abroad?
  FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the
    better.
    I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.

                        Enter another CITIZEN

  THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God speed!
  FIRST CITIZEN. Give you good morrow, sir.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's
    death?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
  THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, look to see a troublous
    world.
  FIRST CITIZEN. No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall
    reign.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child.
  SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,
    Which, in his nonage, council under him,
    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
    No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.
  FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
    Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends,
    God wot;
    For then this land was famously enrich'd
    With politic grave counsel; then the King
    Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Why, so hath this, both by his father and
    mother.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Better it were they all came by his father,
    Or by his father there were none at all;
    For emulation who shall now be nearest
    Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
    O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
    And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;
    And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,
    This sickly land might solace as before.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be
    well.
  THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are seen, wise men put on
    their cloaks;
    When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;
    When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
    Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
    All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
    'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.
    You cannot reason almost with a man
    That looks not heavily and fun of dread.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so;
    By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
    Ensuing danger; as by proof we see
    The water swell before a boist'rous storm.
    But leave it all to God. Whither away?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
  THIRD CITIZEN. And so was I; I'll bear you company.
                                                          Exeunt


ACT2|SC4
                            SCENE 4.

                        London. The palace
            Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young
                DUKE OF YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH,
                   and the DUCHESS OF YORK

  ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
    And at Northampton they do rest to-night;
    To-morrow or next day they will be here.
  DUCHESS. I long with all my heart to see the Prince.
    I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But I hear no; they say my son of York
    Has almost overta'en him in his growth.
  YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
  DUCHESS. Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.
  YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
    My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
    More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester
    'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.'
    And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
    Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.
  DUCHESS. Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
    In him that did object the same to thee.
    He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
    So long a-growing and so leisurely
    That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.
  ARCHBISHOP. And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
  DUCHESS. I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
  YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,
    I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout
    To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
  DUCHESS. How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.
  YORK. Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
    That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
    'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
    Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
  DUCHESS. I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
  YORK. Grandam, his nurse.
  DUCHESS. His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast
    born.
  YORK. If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. A parlous boy! Go to, you are too
    shrewd.
  ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Pitchers have ears.

                        Enter a MESSENGER

  ARCHBISHOP. Here comes a messenger. What news?
  MESSENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince?
  MESSENGER. Well, madam, and in health.
  DUCHESS. What is thy news?
  MESSENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey
    Are sent to Pomfret, and with them
    Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
  DUCHESS. Who hath committed them?
  MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
  ARCHBISHOP. For what offence?
  MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd.
    Why or for what the nobles were committed
    Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!
    The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;
    Insulting tyranny begins to jet
    Upon the innocent and aweless throne.
    Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
    I see, as in a map, the end of all.
  DUCHESS. Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
    How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
    My husband lost his life to get the crown;
    And often up and down my sons were toss'd
    For me to joy and weep their gain and loss;
    And being seated, and domestic broils
    Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors
    Make war upon themselves-brother to brother,
    Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous
    And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,
    Or let me die, to look on death no more!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to
    sanctuary.
    Madam, farewell.
  DUCHESS. Stay, I will go with you.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. You have no cause.
  ARCHBISHOP.  [To the QUEEN]  My gracious lady, go.
    And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
    For my part, I'll resign unto your Grace
    The seal I keep; and so betide to me
    As well I tender you and all of yours!
    Go, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.                Exeunt


ACT3|SC1
                       ACT III. SCENE 1.

                       London. A street
          The trumpets sound. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES,
            GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, CARDINAL
                      BOURCHIER, and others

  BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your
    chamber.
  GLOUCESTER. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.
    The weary way hath made you melancholy.
  PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
    Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
    I want more uncles here to welcome me.
  GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your
    years
    Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit;
    Nor more can you distinguish of a man
    Than of his outward show; which, God He knows,
    Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
    Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
    Your Grace attended to their sug'red words
    But look'd not on the poison of their hearts.
    God keep you from them and from such false friends!
  PRINCE. God keep me from false friends! but they were
    none.
  GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet
    you.

                Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train

  MAYOR. God bless your Grace with health and happy days!
  PRINCE. I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.
    I thought my mother and my brother York
    Would long ere this have met us on the way.
    Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
    To tell us whether they will come or no!

                        Enter LORD HASTINGS

  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating
    Lord.
  PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
  HASTINGS. On what occasion, God He knows, not I,
    The Queen your mother and your brother York
    Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince
    Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,
    But by his mother was perforce withheld.
  BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
    Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace
    Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
    Unto his princely brother presently?
    If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him
    And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
  CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
    Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
    Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
    To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
    We should infringe the holy privilege
    Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land
    Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
  BUCKINGHAM. You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
    Too ceremonious and traditional.
    Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
    You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
    The benefit thereof is always granted
    To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
    And those who have the wit to claim the place.
    This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it,
    And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
    Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
    You break no privilege nor charter there.
    Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
    But sanctuary children never till now.
  CARDINAL. My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.
    Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
  HASTINGS. I go, my lord.
  PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
                                    Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
    Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
    Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
  GLOUCESTER. Where it seems best unto your royal self.
    If I may counsel you, some day or two
    Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower,
    Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
    For your best health and recreation.
  PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place.
    Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
  BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
    Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
  PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported
    Successively from age to age, he built it?
  BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord.
  PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not regist'red,
    Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,
    As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
    Even to the general all-ending day.
  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
    live long.
  PRINCE. What say you, uncle?
  GLOUCESTER. I say, without characters, fame lives long.
    [Aside]  Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
    I moralize two meanings in one word.
  PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
    With what his valour did enrich his wit,
    His wit set down to make his valour live.
    Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
    For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
    I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-
  BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?
  PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,
    I'll win our ancient right in France again,
    Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.
  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward
    spring.

              Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL

  BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of
    York.
  PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
  YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.
  PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
    Too late he died that might have kept that title,
    Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
  GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
  YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
    You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
    The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
  GLOUCESTER. He hath, my lord.
  YORK. And therefore is he idle?
  GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
  YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.
  GLOUCESTER. He may command me as my sovereign;
    But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
  YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
  GLOUCESTER. My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!
  PRINCE. A beggar, brother?
  YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
    And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
  GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
  YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!
  GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
  YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:
    In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
  GLOUCESTER. It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
  YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
  GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, little
    Lord?
  YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
  GLOUCESTER. How?
  YORK. Little.
  PRINCE. My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.
    Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
  YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.
    Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
    Because that I am little, like an ape,
    He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
  BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
    To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
    He prettily and aptly taunts himself.
    So cunning and so young is wonderful.
  GLOUCESTER. My lord, will't please you pass along?
    Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
    Will to your mother, to entreat of her
    To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
  YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
  PRINCE. My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
  YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
  GLOUCESTER. Why, what should you fear?
  YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
    My grandam told me he was murder'd there.
  PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead.
  GLOUCESTER. Nor none that live, I hope.
  PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
    But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
    Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
    A sennet.
              Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY
  BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this little prating York
    Was not incensed by his subtle mother
    To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy;
    Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.
    He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
  BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
    Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
    As closely to conceal what we impart.
    Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way.
    What think'st thou? Is it not an easy matter
    To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
    For the instalment of this noble Duke
    In the seat royal of this famous isle?
  CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince
    That he will not be won to aught against him.
  BUCKINGHAM. What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will
    not he?
  CATESBY. He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle
    Catesby,
    And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
    How he doth stand affected to our purpose;
    And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
    To sit about the coronation.
    If thou dost find him tractable to us,
    Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;
    If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,
    Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,
    And give us notice of his inclination;
    For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
    Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
  GLOUCESTER. Commend me to Lord William. Tell him,
    Catesby,
    His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
    To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;
    And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
    Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
  BUCKINGHAM. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.
  CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
  GLOUCESTER. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
  CATESBY. You shall, my lord.
  GLOUCESTER. At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.
                                                    Exit CATESBY
  BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we
    perceive
    Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
  GLOUCESTER. Chop off his head-something we will
    determine.
    And, look when I am King, claim thou of me
    The earldom of Hereford and all the movables
    Whereof the King my brother was possess'd.
  BUCKINGHAM. I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
  GLOUCESTER. And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
    Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
    We may digest our complots in some form.              Exeunt


ACT3|SC2
                             SCENE 2.

                    Before LORD HASTING'S house
             Enter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS

  MESSENGER. My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]
  HASTINGS.  [Within]  Who knocks?
  MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.
  HASTINGS.  [Within]  What is't o'clock?
  MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.

                        Enter LORD HASTINGS

  HASTINGS. Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious
    nights?
  MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say.
    First, he commends him to your noble self.
  HASTINGS. What then?
  MESSENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night
    He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.
    Besides, he says there are two councils kept,
    And that may be determin'd at the one
    Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
    Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure-
    If you will presently take horse with him
    And with all speed post with him toward the north
    To shun the danger that his soul divines.
  HASTINGS. Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
    Bid him not fear the separated council:
    His honour and myself are at the one,
    And at the other is my good friend Catesby;
    Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
    Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
    Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;
    And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple
    To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.
    To fly the boar before the boar pursues
    Were to incense the boar to follow us
    And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
    Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;
    And we will both together to the Tower,
    Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
  MESSENGER. I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
                                                            Exit

                         Enter CATESBY

  CATESBY. Many good morrows to my noble lord!
  HASTINGS. Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.
    What news, what news, in this our tott'ring state?
  CATESBY. It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;
    And I believe will never stand upright
    Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
  HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the
    crown?
  CATESBY. Ay, my good lord.
  HASTINGS. I'll have this crown of mine cut from my
    shoulders
    Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.
    But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
  CATESBY. Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
    Upon his party for the gain thereof;
    And thereupon he sends you this good news,
    That this same very day your enemies,
    The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.
  HASTINGS. Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
    Because they have been still my adversaries;
    But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side
    To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
    God knows I will not do it to the death.
  CATESBY. God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
  HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
    That they which brought me in my master's hate,
    I live to look upon their tragedy.
    Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
    I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.
  CATESBY. 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
    When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
  HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
    With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do
    With some men else that think themselves as safe
    As thou and I, who, as thou knowest, are dear
    To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
  CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you-
    [Aside]  For they account his head upon the bridge.
  HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have well deserv'd it.

                      Enter LORD STANLEY

    Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
    Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
  STANLEY. My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby.
    You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
    I do not like these several councils, I.
  HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,
    And never in my days, I do protest,
    Was it so precious to me as 'tis now.
    Think you, but that I know our state secure,
    I would be so triumphant as I am?
  STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from
    London,
    Were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure,
    And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
    But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.
    This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;
    Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.
    What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.
  HASTINGS. Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my
    Lord?
    To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded.
  STANLEY. They, for their truth, might better wear their
    heads
    Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats.
    But come, my lord, let's away.

                 Enter HASTINGS, a pursuivant

  HASTINGS. Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
                                      Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
    How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee?
  PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask.
  HASTINGS. I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
    Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet:
    Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
    By the suggestion of the Queen's allies;
    But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-
    This day those enernies are put to death,
    And I in better state than e'er I was.
  PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour's good content!
  HASTINGS. Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me.
                                          [Throws him his purse]
  PURSUIVANT. I thank your honour.                          Exit

                            Enter a PRIEST

  PRIEST. Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
  HASTINGS. I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
    I am in your debt for your last exercise;
    Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
                                        [He whispers in his ear]
  PRIEST. I'll wait upon your lordship.

                            Enter BUCKINGHAM

  BUCKINGHAM. What, talking with a priest, Lord
    Chamberlain!
    Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:
    Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
  HASTINGS. Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
    The men you talk of came into my mind.
    What, go you toward the Tower?
  BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;
    I shall return before your lordship thence.
  HASTINGS. Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
  BUCKINGHAM.  [Aside]  And supper too, although thou
    knowest it not.-
    Come, will you go?
  HASTINGS. I'll wait upon your lordship.                 Exeunt


ACT3|SC3
                              SCENE 3.

                           Pomfret Castle
            Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds,
          carrying the Nobles, RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN,
                            to death

  RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
    To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
    For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
  GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
    A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
  VAUGHAN. You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
  RATCLIFF. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
  RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
    Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
    Within the guilty closure of thy walls
  RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death;
    And for more slander to thy dismal seat,
    We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.
  GREY. Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
    When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I,
    For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
  RIVERS. Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she
    Buckingham,
    Then curs'd she Hastings. O, remember, God,
    To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!
    And for my sister, and her princely sons,
    Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
    Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
  RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
  RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.
    Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.              Exeunt


ACT3|SC4
                             SCENE 4

                        London. The Tower
           Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP
           of ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others and seat
                     themselves at a table

  HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met
    Is to determine of the coronation.
    In God's name speak-when is the royal day?
  BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for the royal time?
  DERBY. It is, and wants but nomination.
  BISHOP OF ELY. To-morrow then I judge a happy day.
  BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind
    herein?
    Who is most inward with the noble Duke?
  BISHOP OF ELY. Your Grace, we think, should soonest know
    his mind.
  BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts,
    He knows no more of mine than I of yours;
    Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.
    Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
  HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
    But for his purpose in the coronation
    I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
    His gracious pleasure any way therein.
    But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;
    And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
    Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

                       Enter GLOUCESTER

  BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.
  GLOUCESTER. My noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.
    I have been long a sleeper, but I trust
    My absence doth neglect no great design
    Which by my presence might have been concluded.
  BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,
  WILLIAM Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part-
    I mean, your voice for crowning of the King.
  GLOUCESTER. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be
    bolder;
    His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
    My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn
    I saw good strawberries in your garden there.
    I do beseech you send for some of them.
  BISHOP of ELY. Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.
                                                            Exit
  GLOUCESTER. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
                                               [Takes him aside]
    Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
    And finds the testy gentleman so hot
    That he will lose his head ere give consent
    His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,
    Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
  BUCKINGHAM. Withdraw yourself awhile; I'll go with you.
                                Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
  DERBY. We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
    To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;
    For I myself am not so well provided
    As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.

                    Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY

  BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?
    I have sent for these strawberries.
  HASTINGS. His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this
    morning;
    There's some conceit or other likes him well
    When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
    I think there's never a man in Christendom
    Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;
    For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
  DERBY. What of his heart perceive you in his face
    By any livelihood he show'd to-day?
  HASTINGS. Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
    For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

               Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM

  GLOUCESTER. I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
    That do conspire my death with devilish plots
    Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
    Upon my body with their hellish charms?
  HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
    Makes me most forward in this princely presence
    To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be.
    I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
  GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
    Look how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm
    Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up.
    And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
    Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
    That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
  HASTINGS. If they have done this deed, my noble lord-
  GLOUCESTER. If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,
    Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.
    Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear
    I will not dine until I see the same.
    Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done.
    The rest that love me, rise and follow me.
                    Exeunt all but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF
  HASTINGS. Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;
    For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
  STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms,
    And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.
    Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
    And started when he look'd upon the Tower,
    As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
    O, now I need the priest that spake to me!
    I now repent I told the pursuivant,
    As too triumphing, how mine enemies
    To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
    And I myself secure in grace and favour.
    O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
    Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
  RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at
    dinner.
    Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
  HASTINGS. O momentary grace of mortal men,
    Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
    Who builds his hope in air of your good looks
    Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
    Ready with every nod to tumble down
    Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
  LOVEL. Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
  HASTINGS. O bloody Richard! Miserable England!
    I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee
    That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
    Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
    They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt


ACT3|SC5
                             SCENE 5.

                    London. The Tower-walls
           Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten
                armour, marvellous ill-favoured

  GLOUCESTER. Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change
    thy colour,
    Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
    And then again begin, and stop again,
    As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?
  BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
    Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
    Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
    Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks
    Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
    And both are ready in their offices
    At any time to grace my stratagems.
    But what, is Catesby gone?
  GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.

                 Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY

  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor-
  GLOUCESTER. Look to the drawbridge there!
  BUCKINGHAM. Hark! a drum.
  GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-
  GLOUCESTER. Look back, defend thee; here are enemies.
  BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!

           Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head

  GLOUCESTER. Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.
  LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
    The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
  GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.
    I took him for the plainest harmless creature
    That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;
    Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
    The history of all her secret thoughts.
    So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
    That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
    I mean his conversation with Shore's wife-
    He liv'd from all attainder of suspects.
  BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red
    traitor
    That ever liv'd.
    Would you imagine, or almost believe-
    Were't not that by great preservation
    We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor
    This day had plotted, in the council-house,
    To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester.
  MAYOR. Had he done so?
  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
    Or that we would, against the form of law,
    Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death
    But that the extreme peril of the case,
    The peace of England and our persons' safety,
    Enforc'd us to this execution?
  MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;
    And your good Graces both have well proceeded
    To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
    I never look'd for better at his hands
    After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
  BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die
    Until your lordship came to see his end-
    Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
    Something against our meanings, have prevented-
    Because, my lord, I would have had you heard
    The traitor speak, and timorously confess
    The manner and the purpose of his treasons:
    That you might well have signified the same
    Unto the citizens, who haply may
    Misconster us in him and wail his death.
  MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve
    As well as I had seen and heard him speak;
    And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,
    But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
    With all your just proceedings in this cause.
  GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
    T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world.
  BUCKINGHAM. Which since you come too late of our intent,
    Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
    And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
                                                 Exit LORD MAYOR
  GLOUCESTER. Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
    The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post.
    There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
    Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
    Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
    Only for saying he would make his son
    Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,
    Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
    Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
    And bestial appetite in change of lust,
    Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,
    Even where his raging eye or savage heart
    Without control lusted to make a prey.
    Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
    Tell them, when that my mother went with child
    Of that insatiate Edward, noble York
    My princely father then had wars in France
    And, by true computation of the time,
    Found that the issue was not his begot;
    Which well appeared in his lineaments,
    Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.
    Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;
    Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
  BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator
    As if the golden fee for which I plead
    Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.
  GLOUCESTER. If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's
    Castle;
    Where you shall find me well accompanied
    With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.
  BUCKINGHAM. I go; and towards three or four o'clock
    Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.           Exit
  GLOUCESTER. Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.
    [To CATESBY]  Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both
    Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
    Now will I go to take some privy order
    To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,
    And to give order that no manner person
    Have any time recourse unto the Princes.                Exit


ACT3|SC6
                            SCENE 6.

                        London. A street
                       Enter a SCRIVENER

  SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
    Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
    That it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's.
    And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
    Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,
    For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;
    The precedent was full as long a-doing;
    And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,
    Untainted, unexamin'd, free, at liberty.
    Here's a good world the while! Who is so gros
    That cannot see this palpable device?
    Yet who's so bold but says he sees it not?
    Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
    When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.          Exit
ACT3|SC7
                            SCENE 7.

                     London. Baynard's Castle
        Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors

  GLOUCESTER. How now, how now! What say the citizens?
  BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord,
    The citizens are mum, say not a word.
  GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's
    children?
  BUCKINGHAM. I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
    And his contract by deputy in France;
    Th' insatiate greediness of his desire,
    And his enforcement of the city wives;
    His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
    As being got, your father then in France,
    And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.
    Withal I did infer your lineaments,
    Being the right idea of your father,
    Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
    Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
    Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
    Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
    Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
    Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse.
    And when mine oratory drew toward end
    I bid them that did love their country's good
    Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal King!'
  GLOUCESTER. And did they so?
  BUCKINGHAM. No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
    But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
    Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
    Which when I saw, I reprehended them,
    And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence.
    His answer was, the people were not used
    To be spoke to but by the Recorder.
    Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again.
    'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
    But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
    When he had done, some followers of mine own
    At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps,
    And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
    And thus I took the vantage of those few-
    'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
    'This general applause and cheerful shout
    Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.'
    And even here brake off and came away.
  GLOUCESTER. What, tongueless blocks were they? Would
    they not speak?
    Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?
  BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
    Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit;
    And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
    And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;
    For on that ground I'll make a holy descant;
    And be not easily won to our requests.
    Play the maid's part: still answer nay, and take it.
  GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as well for them
    As I can say nay to thee for myself,
    No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.
  BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor
    knocks.                                      Exit GLOUCESTER

           Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens

    Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here;
    I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.

                         Enter CATESBY

    Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?
  CATESBY. He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,
    To visit him to-morrow or next day.
    He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
    Divinely bent to meditation;
    And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,
    To draw him from his holy exercise.
  BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;
    Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen,
    In deep designs, in matter of great moment,
    No less importing than our general good,
    Are come to have some conference with his Grace.
  CATESBY. I'll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit
  BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
    He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,
    But on his knees at meditation;
    Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
    But meditating with two deep divines;
    Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
    But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
    Happy were England would this virtuous prince
    Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof;
    But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it.
  MAYOR. Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!
  BUCKINGHAM. I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.

                          Re-enter CATESBY

    Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?
  CATESBY. My lord,
    He wonders to what end you have assembled
    Such troops of citizens to come to him.
    His Grace not being warn'd thereof before,
    He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.
  BUCKINGHAM. Sorry I am my noble cousin should
    Suspect me that I mean no good to him.
    By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
    And so once more return and tell his Grace.
                                                    Exit CATESBY
    When holy and devout religious men
    Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence,
    So sweet is zealous contemplation.

           Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two BISHOPS.
                      CATESBY returns

  MAYOR. See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!
  BUCKINGHAM. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
    To stay him from the fall of vanity;
    And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
    True ornaments to know a holy man.
    Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince,
    Lend favourable ear to our requests,
    And pardon us the interruption
    Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
  GLOUCESTER. My lord, there needs no such apology:
    I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
    Who, earnest in the service of my God,
    Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.
    But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
  BUCKINGHAM. Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
    And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
  GLOUCESTER. I do suspect I have done some offence
    That seems disgracious in the city's eye,
    And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
  BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please
    your Grace,
    On our entreaties, to amend your fault!
  GLOUCESTER. Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
  BUCKINGHAM. Know then, it is your fault that you resign
    The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
    The scept'red office of your ancestors,
    Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
    The lineal glory of your royal house,
    To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;
    Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
    Which here we waken to our country's good,
    The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
    Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,
    Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
    And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf
    Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.
    Which to recure, we heartily solicit
    Your gracious self to take on you the charge
    And kingly government of this your land-
    Not as protector, steward, substitute,
    Or lowly factor for another's gain;
    But as successively, from blood to blood,
    Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
    For this, consorted with the citizens,
    Your very worshipful and loving friends,
    And by their vehement instigation,
    In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell if to depart in silence
    Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
    Best fitteth my degree or your condition.
    If not to answer, you might haply think
    Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
    To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
    Which fondly you would here impose on me;
    If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
    So season'd with your faithful love to me,
    Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
    Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first,
    And then, in speaking, not to incur the last-
    Definitively thus I answer you:
    Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
    Unmeritable shuns your high request.
    First, if all obstacles were cut away,
    And that my path were even to the crown,
    As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
    Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
    So mighty and so many my defects,
    That I would rather hide me from my greatness-
    Being a bark to brook no mighty sea-
    Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
    And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
    But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me-
    And much I need to help you, were there need.
    The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
    Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
    Will well become the seat of majesty
    And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
    On him I lay that you would lay on me-
    The right and fortune of his happy stars,
    Which God defend that I should wring from him.
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, this argues conscience in your
    Grace;
    But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
    All circumstances well considered.
    You say that Edward is your brother's son.
    So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
    For first was he contract to Lady Lucy-
    Your mother lives a witness to his vow-
    And afterward by substitute betroth'd
    To Bona, sister to the King of France.
    These both put off, a poor petitioner,
    A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
    A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
    Even in the afternoon of her best days,
    Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,
    Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree
    To base declension and loath'd bigamy.
    By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
    This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.
    More bitterly could I expostulate,
    Save that, for reverence to some alive,
    I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
    Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
    This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
    If not to bless us and the land withal,
    Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
    From the corruption of abusing times
    Unto a lineal true-derived course.
  MAYOR. Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
  BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
  CATESBY. O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
  GLOUCESTER. Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
    I am unfit for state and majesty.
    I do beseech you, take it not amiss:
    I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
  BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,
    Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;
    As well we know your tenderness of heart
    And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
    Which we have noted in you to your kindred
    And egally indeed to all estates-
    Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,
    Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
    But we will plant some other in the throne
    To the disgrace and downfall of your house;
    And in this resolution here we leave you.
    Come, citizens. Zounds, I'll entreat no more.
  GLOUCESTER. O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, MAYOR, and citizens
  CATESBY. Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit.
    If you deny them, all the land will rue it.
  GLOUCESTER. Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
    Call them again. I am not made of stones,
    But penetrable to your kind entreaties,
    Albeit against my conscience and my soul.

                  Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest

    Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,
    Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
    To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,
    I must have patience to endure the load;
    But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach
    Attend the sequel of your imposition,
    Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
    From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
    For God doth know, and you may partly see,
    How far I am from the desire of this.
  MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.
  GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
  BUCKINGHAM. Then I salute you with this royal title-
    Long live King Richard, England's worthy King!
  ALL. Amen.
  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?
  GLOUCESTER. Even when you please, for you will have it so.
  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;
    And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.
  GLOUCESTER.  [To the BISHOPS]  Come, let us to our holy
    work again.
    Farewell, my cousin; farewell, gentle friends.        Exeunt


ACT4|SC1
                          ACT IV. SCENE 1.

                      London. Before the Tower
             Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS of YORK, and
            MARQUIS of DORSET, at one door; ANNE, DUCHESS
                of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET
               PLANTAGENET, CLARENCE's young daughter,
                         at another door

  DUCHESS. Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet,
    Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
    Now, for my life, she's wand'ring to the Tower,
    On pure heart's love, to greet the tender Princes.
    Daughter, well met.
  ANNE. God give your Graces both
    A happy and a joyful time of day!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As much to you, good sister! Whither
    away?
  ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
    Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
    To gratulate the gentle Princes there.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we'll enter
    all together.

                       Enter BRAKENBURY

    And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
    Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
    How doth the Prince, and my young son of York?
  BRAKENBURY. Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
    I may not suffer you to visit them.
    The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The King! Who's that?
  BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly
    title!
    Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
    I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?
  DUCHESS. I am their father's mother; I will see them.
  ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
    Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,
    And take thy office from thee on my peril.
  BRAKENBURY. No, madam, no. I may not leave it so;
    I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.            Exit

                         Enter STANLEY

  STANLEY. Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
    And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother
    And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
    [To ANNE]  Come, madam, you must straight to
    Westminster,
    There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, cut my lace asunder
    That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
    Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!
  ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
  DORSET. Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee
    gone!
    Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;
    Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
    If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
    And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
    Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
    Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
    And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
    Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
  STANLEY. Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
    Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
    You shall have letters from me to my son
    In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
    Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
  DUCHESS. O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
    O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
    A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
    Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
  STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
  ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go.
    O, would to God that the inclusive verge
    Of golden metal that must round my brow
    Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains!
    Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
    And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen!'
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory.
    To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
  ANNE. No, why? When he that is my husband now
    Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;
    When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
    Which issued from my other angel husband,
    And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd-
    O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
    This was my wish: 'Be thou' quoth I 'accurs'd
    For making me, so young, so old a widow;
    And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
    And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
    More miserable by the life of thee
    Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.'
    Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
    Within so small a time, my woman's heart
    Grossly grew captive to his honey words
    And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse,
    Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;
    For never yet one hour in his bed
    Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
    But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.
    Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
    And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
  ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.
  DORSET. Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!
  ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!
  DUCHESS.  [To DORSET]  Go thou to Richmond, and good
    fortune guide thee!
    [To ANNE]  Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend
    thee!  [To QUEEN ELIZABETH]  Go thou to sanctuary, and good
    thoughts possess thee!
    I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
    Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
    And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Stay, yet look back with me unto the
    Tower.
    Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
    Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls,
    Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
    Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
    For tender princes, use my babies well.
    So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.         Exeunt


ACT4|SC2
                            SCENE 2.

                       London. The palace
         Sound a sennet. Enter RICHARD, in pomp, as KING;
           BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, a PAGE,
                           and others

  KING RICHARD. Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!
  BUCKINGHAM. My gracious sovereign?
  KING RICHARD. Give me thy hand.
                           [Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound]
    Thus high, by thy advice
    And thy assistance, is King Richard seated.
    But shall we wear these glories for a day;
    Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
  BUCKINGHAM. Still live they, and for ever let them last!
  KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
    To try if thou be current gold indeed.
    Young Edward lives-think now what I would speak.
  BUCKINGHAM. Say on, my loving lord.
  KING RICHARD. Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King.
  BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.
  KING RICHARD. Ha! am I King? 'Tis so; but Edward lives.
  BUCKINGHAM. True, noble Prince.
  KING RICHARD. O bitter consequence:
    That Edward still should live-true noble Prince!
    Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
    Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead.
    And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
    What say'st thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief.
  BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace may do your pleasure.
  KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
    Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
  BUCKINGHAM. Give me some little breath, some pause,
    dear Lord,
    Before I positively speak in this.
    I will resolve you herein presently.                    Exit
  CATESBY.  [Aside to another]  The King is angry; see, he
    gnaws his lip.
  KING RICHARD. I will converse with iron-witted fools
                                      [Descends from the throne]
    And unrespective boys; none are for me
    That look into me with considerate eyes.
    High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
    Boy!
  PAGE. My lord?
  KING RICHARD. Know'st thou not any whom corrupting
    gold
    Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
  PAGE. I know a discontented gentleman
    Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
    Gold were as good as twenty orators,
    And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
  KING RICHARD. What is his name?
  PAGE. His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
  KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, call him hither,
    boy.                                               Exit PAGE
    The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
    No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.
    Hath he so long held out with me, untir'd,
    And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.

                            Enter STANLEY

    How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news?
  STANLEY. Know, my loving lord,
    The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled
    To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.    [Stands apart]
  KING RICHARD. Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad
    That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;
    I will take order for her keeping close.
    Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
    Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter-
    The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
    Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
    That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.
    About it; for it stands me much upon
    To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
                                                    Exit CATESBY
    I must be married to my brother's daughter,
    Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
    Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
    Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
    So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
    Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

                     Re-enter PAGE, with TYRREL

    Is thy name Tyrrel?
  TYRREL. James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
  KING RICHARD. Art thou, indeed?
  TYRREL. Prove me, my gracious lord.
  KING RICHARD. Dar'st'thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
  TYRREL. Please you;
    But I had rather kill two enemies.
  KING RICHARD. Why, then thou hast it. Two deep enemies,
    Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,
    Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
  TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
  TYRREL. Let me have open means to come to them,
    And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
  KING RICHARD. Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come
    hither, Tyrrel.
    Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.      [Whispers]
    There is no more but so: say it is done,
    And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.
  TYRREL. I will dispatch it straight.                      Exit

                    Re-enter BUCKINGHAM

    BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I have consider'd in my mind
    The late request that you did sound me in.
  KING RICHARD. Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to
    Richmond.
  BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look
    unto it.
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,
    For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd:
    Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables
    Which you have promised I shall possess.
  KING RICHARD. Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
    Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
  BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highness to my just request?
  KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth
    Did prophesy that Richmond should be King,
    When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
    A king!-perhaps-
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-
  KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that
    time
    Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom-
  KING RICHARD. Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
    The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle
    And call'd it Rugemount, at which name I started,
    Because a bard of Ireland told me once
    I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-
  KING RICHARD. Ay, what's o'clock?
  BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
    Of what you promis'd me.
  KING RICHARD. Well, but o'clock?
  BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten.
  KING RICHARD. Well, let it strike.
  BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike?
  KING RICHARD. Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the
    stroke
    Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
    I am not in the giving vein to-day.
  BUCKINGHAM. May it please you to resolve me in my suit.
  KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
                                       Exeunt all but Buckingham
  BUCKINGHAM. And is it thus? Repays he my deep service
    With such contempt? Made I him King for this?
    O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
    To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!               Exit


ACT4|SC3
                              SCENE 3.

                         London. The palace
                            Enter TYRREL

  TYRREL. The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
    The most arch deed of piteous massacre
    That ever yet this land was guilty of.
    Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn
    To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
    Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
    Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
    Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.
    'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'-
    'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
    Within their alabaster innocent arms.
    Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
    And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
    A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
    Which once,' quoth Forrest 'almost chang'd my mind;
    But, O, the devil'-there the villain stopp'd;
    When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
    The most replenished sweet work of nature
    That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
    Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
    They could not speak; and so I left them both,
    To bear this tidings to the bloody King.

                        Enter KING RICHARD

    And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!
  KING RICHARD. Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
  TYRREL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge
    Beget your happiness, be happy then,
    For it is done.
  KING RICHARD. But didst thou see them dead?
  TYRREL. I did, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
  TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
    But where, to say the truth, I do not know.
  KING RICHARD. Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
    When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
    Meantime, but think how I may do thee good
    And be inheritor of thy desire.
    Farewell till then.
  TYRREL. I humbly take my leave.                           Exit
  KING RICHARD. The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
    His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
    The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
    And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.
    Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims
    At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
    And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,
    To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.

                           Enter RATCLIFF

  RATCLIFF. My lord!
  KING RICHARD. Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so
    bluntly?
  RATCLIFF. Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond;
    And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
    Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
  KING RICHARD. Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
    Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
    Come, I have learn'd that fearful commenting
    Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
    Delay leads impotent and snail-pac'd beggary.
    Then fiery expedition be my wing,
    Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
    Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield.
    We must be brief when traitors brave the field.       Exeunt


ACT4|SC4
                           SCENE 4.

                  London. Before the palace
                  Enter old QUEEN MARGARET

  QUEEN MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mellow
    And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
    Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
    To watch the waning of mine enemies.
    A dire induction am I witness to,
    And will to France, hoping the consequence
    Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
    Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?
                                                       [Retires]

           Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK

  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, my poor princes! ah, my tender
    babes!
    My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
    If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
    And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
    Hover about me with your airy wings
    And hear your mother's lamentation.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Hover about her; say that right for right
    Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
  DUCHESS. So many miseries have craz'd my voice
    That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
    Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  QUEEN MARGARET. Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet,
    Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle
    lambs
    And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
    When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
  QUEEN MARGARET. When holy Harry died, and my sweet
    son.
  DUCHESS. Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,
    Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
    Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
    Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,    [Sitting down]
    Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a
    grave
    As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
    Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
    Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?
                                           [Sitting down by her]
  QUEEN MARGARET.  [Coming forward]  If ancient sorrow be
    most reverend,
    Give mine the benefit of seniory,
    And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
    If sorrow can admit society,        [Sitting down with them]
    Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine.
    I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
    I had a husband, till a Richard kill'd him:
    Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
    Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.
  DUCHESS. I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
    I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard
    kill'd him.
    From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
    A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
    That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes
    To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
    That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
    That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
    That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
    Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.
    O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
    How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
    Preys on the issue of his mother's body
    And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
  DUCHESS. O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
    God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
    And now I cloy me with beholding it.
    Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward;
    The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
    Young York he is but boot, because both they
    Match'd not the high perfection of my loss.
    Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward;
    And the beholders of this frantic play,
    Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
    Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
    Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer;
    Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls
    And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,
    Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.
    Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
    To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.
    Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,
    That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.'
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would
      come
    That I should wish for thee to help me curse
    That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
  QUEEN MARGARET. I Call'd thee then vain flourish of my
      fortune;
    I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen,
    The presentation of but what I was,
    The flattering index of a direful pageant,
    One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below,
    A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
    A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
    To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
    A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
    A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
    Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?
    Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?
    Who sues, and kneels, and says 'God save the Queen'?
    Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?
    Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?
    Decline an this, and see what now thou art:
    For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
    For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
    For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues;
    For Queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
    For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
    For she being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
    For she commanding all, obey'd of none.
    Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about
    And left thee but a very prey to time,
    Having no more but thought of what thou wast
    To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
    Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
    Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
    Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke,
    From which even here I slip my weary head
    And leave the burden of it all on thee.
    Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance;
    These English woes shall make me smile in France.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile
    And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
  QUEEN MARGARET. Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the
      days;
    Compare dead happiness with living woe;
    Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,
    And he that slew them fouler than he is.
    Bett'ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse;
    Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My words are dull; O, quicken them
    with thine!
  QUEEN MARGARET. Thy woes will make them sharp and
    pierce like mine.                                       Exit
  DUCHESS. Why should calamity be fun of words?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Windy attorneys to their client woes,
    Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
    Poor breathing orators of miseries,
    Let them have scope; though what they will impart
    Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart.
  DUCHESS. If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,
    And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
    My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd.
    The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims.

         Enter KING RICHARD and his train, marching with
                     drums and trumpets

  KING RICHARD. Who intercepts me in my expedition?
  DUCHESS. O, she that might have intercepted thee,
    By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
    From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Hidest thou that forehead with a golden
    crown
    Where't should be branded, if that right were right,
    The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown,
    And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
    Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
  DUCHESS. Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother
    Clarence?
    And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan,
    Grey?
  DUCHESS. Where is kind Hastings?
  KING RICHARD. A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!
    Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
    Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say!
                                             [Flourish. Alarums]
    Either be patient and entreat me fair,
    Or with the clamorous report of war
    Thus will I drown your exclamations.
  DUCHESS. Art thou my son?
  KING RICHARD. Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
  DUCHESS. Then patiently hear my impatience.
  KING RICHARD. Madam, I have a touch of your condition
    That cannot brook the accent of reproof.
  DUCHESS. O, let me speak!
  KING RICHARD. Do, then; but I'll not hear.
  DUCHESS. I will be mild and gentle in my words.
  KING RICHARD. And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
  DUCHESS. Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
    God knows, in torment and in agony.
  KING RICHARD. And came I not at last to comfort you?
  DUCHESS. No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well
    Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell.
    A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
    Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
    Thy school-days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and furious;
    Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
    Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,
    More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred.
    What comfortable hour canst thou name
    That ever grac'd me with thy company?
  KING RICHARD. Faith, none but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
    your Grace
    To breakfast once forth of my company.
    If I be so disgracious in your eye,
    Let me march on and not offend you, madam.
    Strike up the drum.
  DUCHESS. I prithee hear me speak.
  KING RICHARD. You speak too bitterly.
  DUCHESS. Hear me a word;
    For I shall never speak to thee again.
  KING RICHARD. So.
  DUCHESS. Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance
    Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror;
    Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
    And never more behold thy face again.
    Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,
    Which in the day of battle tire thee more
    Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
    My prayers on the adverse party fight;
    And there the little souls of Edward's children
    Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
    And promise them success and victory.
    Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.
    Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.        Exit
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Though far more cause, yet much less
      spirit to curse
    Abides in me; I say amen to her.
  KING RICHARD. Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I have no moe sons of the royal blood
    For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,
    They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
    And therefore level not to hit their lives.
  KING RICHARD. You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth.
    Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And must she die for this? O, let her
      live,
    And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,
    Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,
    Throw over her the veil of infamy;
    So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
    I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
  KING RICHARD. Wrong not her birth; she is a royal
    Princess.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To save her life I'll say she is not so.
  KING RICHARD. Her life is safest only in her birth.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And only in that safety died her
      brothers.
  KING RICHARD. Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, to their lives ill friends were
      contrary.
  KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. True, when avoided grace makes destiny.
    My babes were destin'd to a fairer death,
    If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
  KING RICHARD. You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle
      cozen'd
    Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
    Whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts,
    Thy head, an indirectly, gave direction.
    No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt
    Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart
    To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
    But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame,
    My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
    Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
    And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,
    Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
    Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
  KING RICHARD. Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
    And dangerous success of bloody wars,
    As I intend more good to you and yours
    Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What good is cover'd with the face of
      heaven,
    To be discover'd, that can do me good?
  KING RICHARD. advancement of your children, gentle
    lady.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Up to some scaffold, there to lose their
    heads?
  KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of Fortune,
    The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Flatter my sorrow with report of it;
    Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
    Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
  KING RICHARD. Even all I have-ay, and myself and all
    Will I withal endow a child of thine;
    So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
    Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
    Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the process of thy
      kindness
    Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
  KING RICHARD. Then know, that from my soul I love thy
    daughter.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My daughter's mother thinks it with her
    soul.
  KING RICHARD. What do you think?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from
      thy soul.
    So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,
    And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
  KING RICHARD. Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
    I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
    And do intend to make her Queen of England.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be
    her king?
  KING RICHARD. Even he that makes her Queen. Who else
    should be?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What, thou?
  KING RICHARD. Even so. How think you of it?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How canst thou woo her?
  KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you,
    As one being best acquainted with her humour.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And wilt thou learn of me?
  KING RICHARD. Madam, with all my heart.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her
    brothers,
    A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
    'Edward' and 'York.' Then haply will she weep;
    Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret
    Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood-
    A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
    The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,
    And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
    If this inducement move her not to love,
    Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;
    Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,
    Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake
    Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
  KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way
    To win your daughter.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There is no other way;
    Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
    And not be Richard that hath done all this.
  KING RICHARD. Say that I did all this for love of her.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but
      hate thee,
    Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
  KING RICHARD. Look what is done cannot be now amended.
    Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
    Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.
    If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
    To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
    If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
    To quicken your increase I will beget
    Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.
    A grandam's name is little less in love
    Than is the doating title of a mother;
    They are as children but one step below,
    Even of your metal, of your very blood;
    Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
    Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
    Your children were vexation to your youth;
    But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
    The loss you have is but a son being King,
    And by that loss your daughter is made Queen.
    I cannot make you what amends I would,
    Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
    Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
    Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
    This fair alliance quickly shall can home
    To high promotions and great dignity.
    The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
    Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
    Again shall you be mother to a king,
    And all the ruins of distressful times
    Repair'd with double riches of content.
    What! we have many goodly days to see.
    The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
    Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
    Advantaging their loan with interest
    Of ten times double gain of happiness.
    Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;
    Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
    Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
    Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame
    Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes
    With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.
    And when this arm of mine hath chastised
    The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
    Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,
    And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
    To whom I will retail my conquest won,
    And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What were I best to say? Her father's
      brother
    Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?
    Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
    Under what title shall I woo for thee
    That God, the law, my honour, and her love
    Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
  KING RICHARD. Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Which she shall purchase with
    still-lasting war.
  KING RICHARD. Tell her the King, that may command,
    entreats.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King's
    King forbids.
  KING RICHARD. Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To wail the title, as her mother doth.
  KING RICHARD. Say I will love her everlastingly.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
  KING RICHARD. Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life
    last?
  KING RICHARD. As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
  KING RICHARD. Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But she, your subject, loathes such
    sovereignty.
  KING RICHARD. Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. An honest tale speeds best being plainly
    told.
  KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  KING RICHARD. Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, no, my reasons are too deep and
      dead-
    Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.
  KING RICHARD. Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings
    break.
  KING RICHARD. Now, by my George, my garter, and my
    crown-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third
    usurp'd.
  KING RICHARD. I swear-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By nothing; for this is no oath:
    Thy George, profan'd, hath lost his lordly honour;
    Thy garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
    Thy crown, usurp'd, disgrac'd his kingly glory.
    If something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd,
    Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
  KING RICHARD. Then, by my self-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy self is self-misus'd.
  KING RICHARD. Now, by the world-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
  KING RICHARD. My father's death-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy life hath it dishonour'd.
  KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God's wrong is most of all.
    If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,
    The unity the King my husband made
    Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.
    If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
    Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head,
    Had grac'd the tender temples of my child;
    And both the Princes had been breathing here,
    Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,
    Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
    What canst thou swear by now?
  KING RICHARD. The time to come.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time
    o'erpast;
    For I myself have many tears to wash
    Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
    The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd,
    Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
    The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed,
    Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
    Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
    Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast.
  KING RICHARD. As I intend to prosper and repent,
    So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
    Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!
    Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
    Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
    Be opposite all planets of good luck
    To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart's love,
    Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
    I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.
    In her consists my happiness and thine;
    Without her, follows to myself and thee,
    Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
    Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.
    It cannot be avoided but by this;
    It will not be avoided but by this.
    Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-
    Be the attorney of my love to her;
    Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
    Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.
    Urge the necessity and state of times,
    And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
  KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I forget myself to be myself?
  KING RICHARD. Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong
    yourself.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Yet thou didst kill my children.
  KING RICHARD. But in your daughter's womb I bury them;
    Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed
    Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
  KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly,
    And you shall understand from me her mind.
  KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
                               Kissing her. Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
    Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!

                 Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following

    How now! what news?
  RATCLIFF. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
    Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores
    Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
    Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back.
    'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
    And there they hull, expecting but the aid
    Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
  KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of
    Norfolk.
    Ratcliff, thyself-or Catesby; where is he?
  CATESBY. Here, my good lord.
  KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke.
  CATESBY. I will my lord, with all convenient haste.
  KING RICHARD. Ratcliff, come hither. Post to Salisbury;
    When thou com'st thither-  [To CATESBY]  Dull,
    unmindfull villain,
    Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke?
  CATESBY. First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness' pleasure,
    What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.
  KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight
    The greatest strength and power that he can make
    And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
  CATESBY. I go.                                            Exit
  RATCLIFF. What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
  KING RICHARD. Why, what wouldst thou do there before I
    go?
  RATCLIFF. Your Highness told me I should post before.
  KING RICHARD. My mind is chang'd.

                           Enter LORD STANLEY

  STANLEY, what news with you?
  STANLEY. None good, my liege, to please you with
    the hearing;
    Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
  KING RICHARD. Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
    What need'st thou run so many miles about,
    When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?
    Once more, what news?
  STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas.
  KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
    White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
  STANLEY. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
  KING RICHARD. Well, as you guess?
  STANLEY. Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,
    He makes for England here to claim the crown.
  KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd?
    Is the King dead, the empire unpossess'd?
    What heir of York is there alive but we?
    And who is England's King but great York's heir?
    Then tell me what makes he upon the seas.
  STANLEY. Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
  KING RICHARD. Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
    You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
    Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.
  STANLEY. No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.
  KING RICHARD. Where is thy power then, to beat him back?
    Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
    Are they not now upon the western shore,
    Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?
  STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the
    north,
    When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
  STANLEY. They have not been commanded, mighty King.
    Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,
    I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace
    Where and what time your Majesty shall please.
  KING RICHARD. Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with
    Richmond;
    But I'll not trust thee.
  STANLEY. Most mighty sovereign,
    You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
    I never was nor never will be false.
  KING RICHARD. Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind
    Your son, George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,
    Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  STANLEY. So deal with him as I prove true to you.         Exit

                          Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
    As I by friends am well advertised,
    Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,
    Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,
    With many moe confederates, are in arms.

                         Enter another MESSENGER

  SECOND MESSENGER. In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in
    arms;
    And every hour more competitors
    Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.

                         Enter another MESSENGER

  THIRD MESSENGER. My lord, the army of great Buckingham-
  KING RICHARD. Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of
    death?                                      [He strikes him]
    There, take thou that till thou bring better news.
  THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty
    Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
    Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd;
    And he himself wand'red away alone,
    No man knows whither.
  KING RICHARD. I cry thee mercy.
    There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
    Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
    Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  THIRD MESSENGER. Such proclamation hath been made,
    my Lord.

                      Enter another MESSENGER

  FOURTH MESSENGER. Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis
    Dorset,
    'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
    But this good comfort bring I to your Highness-
    The Britaine navy is dispers'd by tempest.
    Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat
    Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
    If they were his assistants, yea or no;
    Who answer'd him they came from Buckingham
    Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,
    Hois'd sail, and made his course again for Britaine.
  KING RICHARD. March on, march on, since we are up in
    arms;
    If not to fight with foreign enemies,
    Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

                          Re-enter CATESBY

  CATESBY. My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken-
    That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond
    Is with a mighty power landed at Milford
    Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
  KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason
    here
    A royal battle might be won and lost.
    Some one take order Buckingham be brought
    To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
    Flourish.                                             Exeunt

                          LORD DERBY'S house
           Enter STANLEY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK

  STANLEY. Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
    That in the sty of the most deadly boar
    My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold;
    If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
    The fear of that holds off my present aid.
    So, get thee gone; commend me to thy lord.
    Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented
    He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
    But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
  CHRISTOPHER. At Pembroke, or at Ha'rford west in Wales.
  STANLEY. What men of name resort to him?
  CHRISTOPHER. Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
  SIR Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
  OXFORD, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
    And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew;
    And many other of great name and worth;
    And towards London do they bend their power,
    If by the way they be not fought withal.
  STANLEY. Well, hie thee to thy lord; I kiss his hand;
    My letter will resolve him of my mind.
    Farewell.                                             Exeunt


ACT5|SC1
                          ACT V. SCENE 1.

                     Salisbury. An open place
          Enter the SHERIFF and guard, with BUCKINGHAM,
                        led to execution

  BUCKINGHAM. Will not King Richard let me speak with
    him?
  SHERIFF. No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
  BUCKINGHAM. Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey, and
    Rivers,
    Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
    Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
    By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
    If that your moody discontented souls
    Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
    Even for revenge mock my destruction!
    This is All-Souls' day, fellow, is it not?
  SHERIFF. It is, my lord.
  BUCKINGHAM. Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's
    doomsday.
    This is the day which in King Edward's time
    I wish'd might fall on me when I was found
    False to his children and his wife's allies;
    This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
    By the false faith of him whom most I trusted;
    This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
    Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs;
    That high All-Seer which I dallied with
    Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
    And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
    Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men
    To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.
    Thus Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck.
    'When he' quoth she 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
    Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
    Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame;
    Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.          Exeunt

                       Camp near Tamworth
            Enter RICHMOND, OXFORD, SIR JAMES BLUNT,
              SIR WALTER HERBERT, and others, with
                         drum and colours

  RICHMOND. Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
    Bruis'd underneath the yoke of tyranny,
    Thus far into the bowels of the land
    Have we march'd on without impediment;
    And here receive we from our father Stanley
    Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
    The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
    That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
    Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
    In your embowell'd bosoms-this foul swine
    Is now even in the centre of this isle,
    Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
    From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
    In God's name cheerly on, courageous friends,
    To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
    By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
  OXFORD. Every man's conscience is a thousand men,
    To fight against this guilty homicide.
  HERBERT. I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.
  BLUNT. He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,
    Which in his dearest need will fly from him.
  RICHMOND. All for our vantage. Then in God's name march.
    True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings;
    Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.      Exeunt


ACT5|SC3
                              SCENE 3.

                           Bosworth Field
              Enter KING RICHARD in arms, with NORFOLK,
              RATCLIFF, the EARL of SURREYS and others

  KING RICHARD. Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth
    field.
    My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
  SURREY. My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
  KING RICHARD. My Lord of Norfolk!
  NORFOLK. Here, most gracious liege.
  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we
    not?
  NORFOLK. We must both give and take, my loving lord.
  KING RICHARD. Up With my tent! Here will I lie to-night;
                      [Soldiers begin to set up the KING'S tent]
    But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
    Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
  NORFOLK. Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
  KING RICHARD. Why, our battalia trebles that account;
    Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength,
    Which they upon the adverse faction want.
    Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
    Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
    Call for some men of sound direction.
    Let's lack no discipline, make no delay;
    For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.                  Exeunt

             Enter, on the other side of the field,
          RICHMOND, SIR WILLIAM BRANDON, OXFORD, DORSET,
              and others. Some pitch RICHMOND'S tent

  RICHMOND. The weary sun hath made a golden set,
    And by the bright tract of his fiery car
    Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.
    Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
    Give me some ink and paper in my tent.
    I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
    Limit each leader to his several charge,
    And part in just proportion our small power.
    My Lord of Oxford-you, Sir William Brandon-
    And you, Sir Walter Herbert-stay with me.
    The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment;
    Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him,
    And by the second hour in the morning
    Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.
    Yet one thing more, good Captain, do for me-
    Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, do you know?
  BLUNT. Unless I have mista'en his colours much-
    Which well I am assur'd I have not done-
    His regiment lies half a mile at least
    South from the mighty power of the King.
  RICHMOND. If without peril it be possible,
    Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him
    And give him from me this most needful note.
  BLUNT. Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;
    And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
  RICHMOND. Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come,
    gentlemen,
    Let us consult upon to-morrow's business.
    In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold.
                                   [They withdraw into the tent]

            Enter, to his-tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK,
                       RATCLIFF, and CATESBY

  KING RICHARD. What is't o'clock?
  CATESBY. It's supper-time, my lord;
    It's nine o'clock.
  KING RICHARD. I will not sup to-night.
    Give me some ink and paper.
    What, is my beaver easier than it was?
    And all my armour laid into my tent?
  CATESBY. It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
  KING RICHARD. Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
    Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
  NORFOLK. I go, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
  NORFOLK. I warrant you, my lord.                          Exit
  KING RICHARD. Catesby!
  CATESBY. My lord?
  KING RICHARD. Send out a pursuivant-at-arms
    To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
    Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
    Into the blind cave of eternal night.           Exit CATESBY
    Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
    Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
    Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
    Ratcliff!
  RATCLIFF. My lord?
  KING RICHARD. Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord
    Northumberland?
  RATCLIFF. Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
    Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
    Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
  KING RICHARD. So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.
    I have not that alacrity of spirit
    Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.
    Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
  RATCLIFF. It is, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Bid my guard watch; leave me.
  RATCLIFF, about the mid of night come to my tent
    And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
                                   Exit RATCLIFF. RICHARD sleeps

               Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent;
                        LORDS attending

  DERBY. Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
  RICHMOND. All comfort that the dark night can afford
    Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
    Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
  DERBY. I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
    Who prays continually for Richmond's good.
    So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
    And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
    In brief, for so the season bids us be,
    Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
    And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
    Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
    I, as I may-that which I would I cannot-
    With best advantage will deceive the time
    And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms;
    But on thy side I may not be too forward,
    Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
    Be executed in his father's sight.
    Farewell; the leisure and the fearful time
    Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
    And ample interchange of sweet discourse
    Which so-long-sund'red friends should dwell upon.
    God give us leisure for these rites of love!
    Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!
  RICHMOND. Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.
    I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,
    Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow
    When I should mount with wings of victory.
    Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
                                         Exeunt all but RICHMOND
    O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
    Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
    Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath,
    That they may crush down with a heavy fall
    The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
    Make us Thy ministers of chastisement,
    That we may praise Thee in the victory!
    To Thee I do commend my watchful soul
    Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.
    Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!            [Sleeps]

            Enter the GHOST Of YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD,
                    son to HENRY THE SIXTH

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy on thy soul
    to-morrow!
    Think how thou stabb'dst me in my prime of youth
    At Tewksbury; despair, therefore, and die!
    [To RICHMOND]  Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged
    souls
    Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf.
    King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.

              Enter the GHOST of HENRY THE SIXTH

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  When I was mortal, my anointed
    body
    By thee was punched full of deadly holes.
    Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die.
    Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
    [To RICHMOND]  Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!
    Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be King,
    Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish!

                   Enter the GHOST of CLARENCE

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy soul
    to-morrow! I that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,
    Poor Clarence, by thy guile betray'd to death!
    To-morrow in the battle think on me,
    And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!
    [To RICHMOND]  Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,
    The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee.
    Good angels guard thy battle! Live and flourish!

           Enter the GHOSTS of RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN

  GHOST OF RIVERS.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy
    soul to-morrow,
    Rivers that died at Pomfret! Despair and die!
  GHOST OF GREY.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Grey, and let
    thy soul despair!
  GHOST OF VAUGHAN.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Vaughan,
    and with guilty fear
    Let fall thy lance. Despair and die!
  ALL.  [To RICHMOND]  Awake, and think our wrongs in
    Richard's bosom
    Will conquer him. Awake and win the day.

                Enter the GHOST of HASTINGS

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
    And in a bloody battle end thy days!
    Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die.
    [To RICHMOND]   Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
    Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!

         Enter the GHOSTS of the two young PRINCES

  GHOSTS.  [To RICHARD]  Dream on thy cousins smothered in
    the Tower.
    Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
    And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
    Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.
    [To RICHMOND]  Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and
    wake in joy;
    Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
    Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
    Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

          Enter the GHOST of LADY ANNE, his wife

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Richard, thy wife, that wretched
    Anne thy wife
    That never slept a quiet hour with thee
    Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
    To-morrow in the battle think on me,
    And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.
    [To RICHMOND]  Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;
    Dream of success and happy victory.
    Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.

                   Enter the GHOST of BUCKINGHAM

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  The first was I that help'd thee
    to the crown;
    The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
    O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
    And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
    Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death;
    Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
    [To RICHMOND]  I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid;
    But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd:
    God and good angels fight on Richmond's side;
    And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
            [The GHOSTS vanish. RICHARD starts out of his dream]
  KING RICHARD. Give me another horse. Bind up my wounds.
    Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.
    O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
    The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
    Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
    What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by.
    Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
    Is there a murderer here? No-yes, I am.
    Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why-
    Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself!
    Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good
    That I myself have done unto myself?
    O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself
    For hateful deeds committed by myself!
    I am a villain; yet I lie, I am not.
    Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.
    My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
    And every tongue brings in a several tale,
    And every tale condemns me for a villain.
    Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;
    Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;
    All several sins, all us'd in each degree,
    Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!'
    I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
    And if I die no soul will pity me:
    And wherefore should they, since that I myself
    Find in myself no pity to myself?
    Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
    Came to my tent, and every one did threat
    To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

                            Enter RATCLIFF

  RATCLIFF. My lord!
  KING RICHARD. Zounds, who is there?
  RATCLIFF. Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
    Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
    Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.
  KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
    What think'st thou-will our friends prove all true?
  RATCLIFF. No doubt, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear.
  RATCLIFF. Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
  KING RICHARD By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
    Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard
    Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
    Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
    'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
    Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
    To see if any mean to shrink from me.                 Exeunt

          Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sitting in his tent

  LORDS. Good morrow, Richmond!
  RICHMOND. Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
    That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
  LORDS. How have you slept, my lord?
  RICHMOND. The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
    That ever ent'red in a drowsy head
    Have I since your departure had, my lords.
    Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd
    Came to my tent and cried on victory.
    I promise you my soul is very jocund
    In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
    How far into the morning is it, lords?
  LORDS. Upon the stroke of four.
  RICHMOND. Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.

                 His ORATION to his SOLDIERS

    More than I have said, loving countrymen,
    The leisure and enforcement of the time
    Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:
    God and our good cause fight upon our side;
    The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
    Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
    Richard except, those whom we fight against
    Had rather have us win than him they follow.
    For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
    A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
    One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
    One that made means to come by what he hath,
    And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
    A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
    Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
    One that hath ever been God's enemy.
    Then if you fight against God's enemy,
    God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
    If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
    You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
    If you do fight against your country's foes,
    Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire;
    If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
    Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
    If you do free your children from the sword,
    Your children's children quits it in your age.
    Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
    Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
    For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
    Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
    But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
    The least of you shall share his part thereof.
    Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
    God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!           Exeunt

           Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, attendants,
                         and forces

  KING RICHARD. What said Northumberland as touching
    Richmond?
  RATCLIFF. That he was never trained up in arms.
  KING RICHARD. He said the truth; and what said Surrey
    then?
  RATCLIFF. He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.'
  KING He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
                                                 [Clock strikes]
    Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
    Who saw the sun to-day?
  RATCLIFF. Not I, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
    He should have brav'd the east an hour ago.
    A black day will it be to somebody.
    Ratcliff!
  RATCLIFF. My lord?
  KING RICHARD. The sun will not be seen to-day;
    The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
    I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
    Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
    More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven
    That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

                       Enter NORFOLK

  NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
  KING RICHARD. Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse;
    Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.
    I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
    And thus my battle shall be ordered:
    My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
    Consisting equally of horse and foot;
    Our archers shall be placed in the midst.
    John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
    Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
    They thus directed, we will follow
    In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
    Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
    This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou,
    Norfolk?
  NORFOLK. A good direction, warlike sovereign.
    This found I on my tent this morning.
                                        [He sheweth him a paper]
  KING RICHARD.                                          [Reads]
    'Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold,
    For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
    A thing devised by the enemy.
    Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.
    Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;
    Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
    Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe.
    Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
    March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell;
    If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.

                      His ORATION to his ARMY

    What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
    Remember whom you are to cope withal-
    A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
    A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
    Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
    To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.
    You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
    You having lands, and bless'd with beauteous wives,
    They would restrain the one, distain the other.
    And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
    Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost?
    A milk-sop, one that never in his life
    Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
    Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
    Lash hence these over-weening rags of France,
    These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
    Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
    For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves.
    If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
    And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers
    Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
    And, in record, left them the heirs of shame.
    Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives,
    Ravish our daughters?  [Drum afar off]  Hark! I hear their
    drum.
    Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen!
    Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
    Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
    Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!

                        Enter a MESSENGER

    What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?
  MESSENGER. My lord, he doth deny to come.
  KING RICHARD. Off with his son George's head!
  NORFOLK. My lord, the enemy is pass'd the marsh.
    After the battle let George Stanley die.
  KING RICHARD. A thousand hearts are great within my
    bosom.
    Advance our standards, set upon our foes;
    Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
    Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
    Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.                 Exeunt

                     Another part of the field
            Alarum; excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces;
                         to him CATESBY

  CATESBY. Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
    The King enacts more wonders than a man,
    Daring an opposite to every danger.
    His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
    Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
    Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost.

                     Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD

  KING RICHARD. A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
  CATESBY. Withdraw, my lord! I'll help you to a horse.
  KING RICHARD. Slave, I have set my life upon a cast
    And I Will stand the hazard of the die.
    I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
    Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
    A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt

                    Another part of the field
         Alarum. Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND; they fight;
          RICHARD is slain. Retreat and flourish. Enter
        RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the crown, with other LORDS

  RICHMOND. God and your arms be prais'd, victorious friends;
    The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
  DERBY. Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee!
    Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
    From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
    Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal.
    Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
  RICHMOND. Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
    But, teLL me is young George Stanley living.
  DERBY. He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
    Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
  RICHMOND. What men of name are slain on either side?
  DERBY. John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
    Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
  RICHMOND. Inter their bodies as becomes their births.
    Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
    That in submission will return to us.
    And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
    We will unite the white rose and the red.
    Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
    That long have frown'd upon their emnity!
    What traitor hears me, and says not Amen?
    England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
    The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
    The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
    The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire;
    All this divided York and Lancaster,
    Divided in their dire division,
    O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,
    The true succeeders of each royal house,
    By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
    And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,
    Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace,
    With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!
    Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
    That would reduce these bloody days again
    And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
    Let them not live to taste this land's increase
    That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
    Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again-
    That she may long live here, God say Amen!            Exeunt

ACT1|SC1
                          ACT I. SCENE 1.

                          London. A street
             Enter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus

  GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent
    Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
    And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
    Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,
    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
    Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,
    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
    He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
    But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,
    Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-
    I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph-
    I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
    Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
    Into this breathing world scarce half made up,
    And that so lamely and unfashionable
    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-
    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
    Have no delight to pass away the time,
    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
    And descant on mine own deformity.
    And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
    To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
    I am determined to prove a villain
    And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
    Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
    By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
    To set my brother Clarence and the King
    In deadly hate the one against the other;
    And if King Edward be as true and just
    As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
    This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up-
    About a prophecy which says that G
    Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
    Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.

             Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY

    Brother, good day. What means this armed guard
    That waits upon your Grace?
  CLARENCE. His Majesty,
    Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed
    This conduct to convey me to th' Tower.
  GLOUCESTER. Upon what cause?
  CLARENCE. Because my name is George.
  GLOUCESTER. Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:
    He should, for that, commit your godfathers.
    O, belike his Majesty hath some intent
    That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower.
    But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?
  CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
    As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,
    He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
    And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
    And says a wizard told him that by G
    His issue disinherited should be;
    And, for my name of George begins with G,
    It follows in his thought that I am he.
    These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
    Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now.
  GLOUCESTER. Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:
    'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
    My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
    That tempers him to this extremity.
    Was it not she and that good man of worship,
    Antony Woodville, her brother there,
    That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
    From whence this present day he is delivered?
    We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
  CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
    But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds
    That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.
    Heard you not what an humble suppliant
    Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?
  GLOUCESTER. Humbly complaining to her deity
    Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
    I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,
    If we will keep in favour with the King,
    To be her men and wear her livery:
    The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,
    Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,
    Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.
  BRAKENBURY. I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
    His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
    That no man shall have private conference,
    Of what degree soever, with your brother.
  GLOUCESTER. Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
    You may partake of any thing we say:
    We speak no treason, man; we say the King
    Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
    Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
    We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
    A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
    And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.
    How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?
  BRAKENBURY. With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.
  GLOUCESTER. Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,
    fellow,
    He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
    Were best to do it secretly alone.
  BRAKENBURY. What one, my lord?
  GLOUCESTER. Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?
  BRAKENBURY. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and
    withal
    Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.
  CLARENCE. We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
    obey.
  GLOUCESTER. We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.
    Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;
    And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-
    Were it to call King Edward's widow sister-
    I will perform it to enfranchise you.
    Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
    Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
  CLARENCE. I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
  GLOUCESTER. Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
    I will deliver or else lie for you.
    Meantime, have patience.
  CLARENCE. I must perforce. Farewell.
                          Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard
  GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
    Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so
    That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
    If heaven will take the present at our hands.
    But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?

                       Enter LORD HASTINGS

  HASTINGS. Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
  GLOUCESTER. As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!
    Well are you welcome to the open air.
    How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
  HASTINGS. With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;
    But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
    That were the cause of my imprisonment.
  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
    For they that were your enemies are his,
    And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
  HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew'd
    Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
  GLOUCESTER. What news abroad?
  HASTINGS. No news so bad abroad as this at home:
    The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
    And his physicians fear him mightily.
  GLOUCESTER. Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.
    O, he hath kept an evil diet long
    And overmuch consum'd his royal person!
    'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
    Where is he? In his bed?
  HASTINGS. He is.
  GLOUCESTER. Go you before, and I will follow you.
                                                   Exit HASTINGS
    He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
    Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.
    I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence
    With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
    And, if I fail not in my deep intent,
    Clarence hath not another day to live;
    Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
    And leave the world for me to bustle in!
    For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
    What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
    The readiest way to make the wench amends
    Is to become her husband and her father;
    The which will I-not all so much for love
    As for another secret close intent
    By marrying her which I must reach unto.
    But yet I run before my horse to market.
    Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns;
    When they are gone, then must I count my gains.         Exit

                      London. Another street
            Enter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH, with
            halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the
            mourner, attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY

  ANNE. Set down, set down your honourable load-
    If honour may be shrouded in a hearse;
    Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
    Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
    Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
    Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
    Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
    Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
    To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
    Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,
    Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds.
    Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
    I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
    O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!
    Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!
    Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
    More direful hap betide that hated wretch
    That makes us wretched by the death of thee
    Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
    Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
    If ever he have child, abortive be it,
    Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
    Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
    May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
    And that be heir to his unhappiness!
    If ever he have wife, let her be made
    More miserable by the death of him
    Than I am made by my young lord and thee!
    Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
    Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
    And still as you are weary of this weight
    Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
                                [The bearers take up the coffin]

                      Enter GLOUCESTER

  GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
  ANNE. What black magician conjures up this fiend
    To stop devoted charitable deeds?
  GLOUCESTER. Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
    I'll make a corse of him that disobeys!
  FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the coffin
    pass.
  GLOUCESTER. Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command.
    Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
    Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot
    And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
                               [The bearers set down the coffin]
  ANNE. What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
    Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
    And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
    Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
    Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
    His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.
  GLOUCESTER. Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
  ANNE. Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;
    For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
    Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
    If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
    Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
    O, gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry's wounds
    Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh.
    Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,
    For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
    From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;
    Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
    Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
    O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!
    O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!
    Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;
    Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
    As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,
    Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.
  GLOUCESTER. Lady, you know no rules of charity,
    Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
  ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:
    No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
  GLOUCESTER. But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
  ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
  GLOUCESTER. More wonderful when angels are so angry.
    Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
    Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
    By circumstance but to acquit myself.
  ANNE. Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,
    Of these known evils but to give me leave
    By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.
  GLOUCESTER. Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
    Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
  ANNE. Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
    No excuse current but to hang thyself.
  GLOUCESTER. By such despair I should accuse myself.
  ANNE. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
    For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
    That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
  GLOUCESTER. Say that I slew them not?
  ANNE. Then say they were not slain.
    But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.
  GLOUCESTER. I did not kill your husband.
  ANNE. Why, then he is alive.
  GLOUCESTER. Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.
  ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
    Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood;
    The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
    But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
  GLOUCESTER. I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue
    That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
  ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
    That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.
    Didst thou not kill this king?
  GLOUCESTER. I grant ye.
  ANNE. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to
    Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
    O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
  GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath
    him.
  ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
  GLOUCESTER. Let him thank me that holp to send him
    thither,
    For he was fitter for that place than earth.
  ANNE. And thou unfit for any place but hell.
  GLOUCESTER. Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
  ANNE. Some dungeon.
  GLOUCESTER. Your bed-chamber.
  ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
  GLOUCESTER. So will it, madam, till I lie with you.
  ANNE. I hope so.
  GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
    To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
    And fall something into a slower method-
    Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
    Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
    As blameful as the executioner?
  ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.
  GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect-
    Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
    To undertake the death of all the world
    So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
  ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
    These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
  GLOUCESTER. These eyes could not endure that beauty's
    wreck;
    You should not blemish it if I stood by.
    As all the world is cheered by the sun,
    So I by that; it is my day, my life.
  ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
  GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.
  ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.
  GLOUCESTER. It is a quarrel most unnatural,
    To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.
  ANNE. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
    To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.
  GLOUCESTER. He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband
    Did it to help thee to a better husband.
  ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
  GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves thee better than he could.
  ANNE. Name him.
  GLOUCESTER. Plantagenet.
  ANNE. Why, that was he.
  GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature.
  ANNE. Where is he?
  GLOUCESTER. Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit
    at me?
  ANNE. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
  GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.
  ANNE. Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
    Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.
  GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
  ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!
  GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;
    For now they kill me with a living death.
    Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
    Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-
    These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,
    No, when my father York and Edward wept
    To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
    When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;
    Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
    Told the sad story of my father's death,
    And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
    That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
    Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time
    My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
    And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
    Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
    I never sued to friend nor enemy;
    My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
    But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,
    My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
                                   [She looks scornfully at him]
    Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made
    For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
    If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
    Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
    Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
    And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
    I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
    And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
      [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]
    Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-
    But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
    Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward-
    But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
                                           [She falls the sword]
    Take up the sword again, or take up me.
  ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,
    I will not be thy executioner.
  GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;
  ANNE. I have already.
  GLOUCESTER. That was in thy rage.
    Speak it again, and even with the word
    This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
    Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
    To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.
  ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.
  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue.
  ANNE. I fear me both are false.
  GLOUCESTER. Then never was man true.
  ANNE. well put up your sword.
  GLOUCESTER. Say, then, my peace is made.
  ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.
  GLOUCESTER. But shall I live in hope?
  ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.
  GLOUCESTER. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
  ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]
  GLOUCESTER. Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
    Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
    Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
    And if thy poor devoted servant may
    But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
    Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
  ANNE. What is it?
  GLOUCESTER. That it may please you leave these sad designs
    To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
    And presently repair to Crosby House;
    Where-after I have solemnly interr'd
    At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king,
    And wet his grave with my repentant tears-
    I will with all expedient duty see you.
    For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,
    Grant me this boon.
  ANNE. With all my heart; and much it joys me too
    To see you are become so penitent.
    Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
  GLOUCESTER. Bid me farewell.
  ANNE. 'Tis more than you deserve;
    But since you teach me how to flatter you,
    Imagine I have said farewell already.
                             Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY ANNE
  GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse.
  GENTLEMEN. Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
  GLOUCESTER. No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.
                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
    Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
    Was ever woman in this humour won?
    I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
    What! I that kill'd her husband and his father-
    To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
    With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
    The bleeding witness of my hatred by;
    Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
    And I no friends to back my suit at all
    But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
    And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
    Ha!
    Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
    Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
    Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
    A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-
    Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,
    Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-
    The spacious world cannot again afford;
    And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
    That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince
    And made her widow to a woeful bed?
    On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
    On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
    My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
    I do mistake my person all this while.
    Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
    Myself to be a marv'llous proper man.
    I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
    And entertain a score or two of tailors
    To study fashions to adorn my body.
    Since I am crept in favour with myself,
    I will maintain it with some little cost.
    But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,
    And then return lamenting to my love.
    Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
    That I may see my shadow as I pass.                     Exit


ACT1|SC3
                            SCENE 3.

                       London. The palace
               Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, LORD RIVERS,
                         and LORD GREY

  RIVERS. Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty
    Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
  GREY. In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
    Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
    And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. If he were dead, what would betide on
    me?
  GREY. No other harm but loss of such a lord.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all
    harms.
  GREY. The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son
    To be your comforter when he is gone.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, he is young; and his minority
    Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
    A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
  RIVER. Is it concluded he shall be Protector?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. It is determin'd, not concluded yet;
    But so it must be, if the King miscarry.

                     Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY

  GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.
  BUCKINGHAM. Good time of day unto your royal Grace!
  DERBY. God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Countess Richmond, good my Lord
    of Derby,
    To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
    Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife
    And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
    I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
  DERBY. I do beseech you, either not believe
    The envious slanders of her false accusers;
    Or, if she be accus'd on true report,
    Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
    From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of
    Derby?
  DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
    Are come from visiting his Majesty.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What likelihood of his amendment,
    Lords?
  BUCKINGHAM. Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks
    cheerfully.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God grant him health! Did you confer
    with him?
  BUCKINGHAM. Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement
    Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
    And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;
    And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Would all were well! But that will
    never be.
    I fear our happiness is at the height.

              Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET

  GLOUCESTER. They do me wrong, and I will not endure it.
    Who is it that complains unto the King
    That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?
    By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
    That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
    Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
    Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
    Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
    I must be held a rancorous enemy.
    Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
    But thus his simple truth must be abus'd
    With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
  GREY. To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?
  GLOUCESTER. To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
    When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong,
    Or thee, or thee, or any of your faction?
    A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-
    Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-
    Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while
    But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the
    matter.
    The King, on his own royal disposition
    And not provok'd by any suitor else-
    Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred
    That in your outward action shows itself
    Against my children, brothers, and myself-
    Makes him to send that he may learn the ground.
  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad
    That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
    Since every Jack became a gentleman,
    There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, we know your meaning,
    brother Gloucester:
    You envy my advancement and my friends';
    God grant we never may have need of you!
  GLOUCESTER. Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.
    Our brother is imprison'd by your means,
    Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility
    Held in contempt; while great promotions
    Are daily given to ennoble those
    That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By Him that rais'd me to this careful
    height
    From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
    I never did incense his Majesty
    Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
    An earnest advocate to plead for him.
    My lord, you do me shameful injury
    Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
  GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean
    Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
  RIVERS. She may, my lord; for-
  GLOUCESTER. She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows
    not so?
    She may do more, sir, than denying that:
    She may help you to many fair preferments
    And then deny her aiding hand therein,
    And lay those honours on your high desert.
    What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-
  RIVERS. What, marry, may she?
  GLOUCESTER. What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
    A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.
    Iwis your grandam had a worser match.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long
    borne
    Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
    By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
    Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.
    I had rather be a country servant-maid
    Than a great queen with this condition-
    To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at.

                Enter old QUEEN MARGARET, behind

    Small joy have I in being England's Queen.
  QUEEN MARGARET. And less'ned be that small, God, I
    beseech Him!
    Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.
  GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with telling of the
    King?
    Tell him and spare not. Look what I have said
    I will avouch't in presence of the King.
    I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r.
    'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Out, devil! I do remember them to
    well:
    Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,
    And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
  GLOUCESTER. Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband
    King,
    I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,
    A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
    A liberal rewarder of his friends;
    To royalize his blood I spent mine own.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, and much better blood than his or
    thine.
  GLOUCESTER. In all which time you and your husband Grey
    Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
    And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
    In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain?
    Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
    What you have been ere this, and what you are;
    Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
  QUEEN MARGARET. A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.
  GLOUCESTER. Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,
    Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!-
  QUEEN MARGARET. Which God revenge!
  GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
    And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
    I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's,
    Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.
    I am too childish-foolish for this world.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
    world,
    Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is.
  RIVERS. My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
    Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
    We follow'd then our lord, our sovereign king.
    So should we you, if you should be our king.
  GLOUCESTER. If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar.
    Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
    You should enjoy were you this country's king,
    As little joy you may suppose in me
    That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.
  QUEEN MARGARET. As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;
    For I am she, and altogether joyless.
    I can no longer hold me patient.                 [Advancing]
    Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
    In sharing that which you have pill'd from me.
    Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
    If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,
    Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?
    Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!
  GLOUCESTER. Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my
    sight?
  QUEEN MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,
    That will I make before I let thee go.
  GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
  QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in
    banishment
    Than death can yield me here by my abode.
    A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;
    And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.
    This sorrow that I have by right is yours;
    And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
  GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee,
    When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
    And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
    And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout
    Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-
    His curses then from bitterness of soul
    Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee;
    And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent.
  HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
    And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
  RIVERS. Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
  DORSET. No man but prophesied revenge for it.
  BUCKINGHAM. Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
  QUEEN MARGARET. What, were you snarling all before I came,
    Ready to catch each other by the throat,
    And turn you all your hatred now on me?
    Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven
    That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
    Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,
    Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
    Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
    Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
    Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,
    As ours by murder, to make him a king!
    Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,
    For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,
    Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
    Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
    Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
    Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,
    And see another, as I see thee now,
    Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
    Long die thy happy days before thy death;
    And, after many length'ned hours of grief,
    Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!
    Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
    And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
    Was stabb'd with bloody daggers. God, I pray him,
    That none of you may live his natural age,
    But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
  GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd
    hag.
  QUEEN MARGARET. And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou
    shalt hear me.
    If heaven have any grievous plague in store
    Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
    O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
    And then hurl down their indignation
    On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
    The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul!
    Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,
    And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
    No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
    Unless it be while some tormenting dream
    Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
    Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog,
    Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
    The slave of nature and the son of hell,
    Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb,
    Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins,
    Thou rag of honour, thou detested-
  GLOUCESTER. Margaret!
  QUEEN MARGARET. Richard!
  GLOUCESTER. Ha?
  QUEEN MARGARET. I call thee not.
  GLOUCESTER. I cry thee mercy then, for I did think
    That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.
    O, let me make the period to my curse!
  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thus have you breath'd your curse
    against yourself.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my
    fortune!
    Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider
    Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
    Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
    The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
    To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad.
  HASTINGS. False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
    Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Foul shame upon you! you have all
    mov'd mine.
  RIVERS. Were you well serv'd, you would be taught your
      duty.
  QUEEN MARGARET. To serve me well you all should do me
    duty,
    Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects.
    O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
  DORSET. Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert;
    Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
    O, that your young nobility could judge
    What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!
    They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
    And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.
  GLOUCESTER. Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.
  DORSET. It touches you, my lord, as much as me.
  GLOUCESTER. Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,
    Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
    And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.
  QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!
    Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
    Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
    Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
    Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
    O God that seest it, do not suffer it;
    As it is won with blood, lost be it so!
  BUCKINGHAM. Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!
  QUEEN MARGARET. Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
    Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
    And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.
    My charity is outrage, life my shame;
    And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!
  BUCKINGHAM. Have done, have done.
  QUEEN MARGARET. O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy
    hand
    In sign of league and amity with thee.
    Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
    Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
    Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
  BUCKINGHAM. Nor no one here; for curses never pass
    The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
  QUEEN MARGARET. I will not think but they ascend the sky
    And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
    O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
    Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
    His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
    Have not to do with him, beware of him;
    Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,
    And all their ministers attend on him.
  GLOUCESTER. What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
  BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
  QUEEN MARGARET. What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle
    counsel,
    And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
    O, but remember this another day,
    When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
    And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
    Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
    And he to yours, and all of you to God's!               Exit
  BUCKINGHAM. My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
  RIVERS. And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.
  GLOUCESTER. I cannot blame her; by God's holy Mother,
    She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
    My part thereof that I have done to her.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I never did her any to my knowledge.
  GLOUCESTER. Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
    I was too hot to do somebody good
    That is too cold in thinking of it now.
    Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;
    He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains;
    God pardon them that are the cause thereof!
  RIVERS. A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
    To pray for them that have done scathe to us!
  GLOUCESTER. So do I ever-  [Aside]  being well advis'd;
    For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself.

                         Enter CATESBY

  CATESBY. Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,
    And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go
    with me?
  RIVERS. We wait upon your Grace.
                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
  GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
    The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
    I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
    Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,
    I do beweep to many simple gulls;
    Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;
    And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies
    That stir the King against the Duke my brother.
    Now they believe it, and withal whet me
    To be reveng'd on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;
    But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture,
    Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.
    And thus I clothe my naked villainy
    With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ,
    And seem a saint when most I play the devil.

                       Enter two MURDERERS

    But, soft, here come my executioners.
    How now, my hardy stout resolved mates!
    Are you now going to dispatch this thing?
  FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the
    warrant,
    That we may be admitted where he is.
  GLOUCESTER. Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
                                             [Gives the warrant]
    When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
    But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
    Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
    For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
    May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.
  FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to
    prate;
    Talkers are no good doers. Be assur'd
    We go to use our hands and not our tongues.
  GLOUCESTER. Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall
    tears.
    I like you, lads; about your business straight;
    Go, go, dispatch.
  FIRST MURDERER. We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt


ACT1|SC4
                            SCENE 4.

                        London. The Tower
                    Enter CLARENCE and KEEPER

  KEEPER. Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?
  CLARENCE. O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
    So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
    That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
    I would not spend another such a night
    Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days-
    So full of dismal terror was the time!
  KEEPER. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
    tell me.
  CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
    And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
    And in my company my brother Gloucester,
    Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
    Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,
    And cited up a thousand heavy times,
    During the wars of York and Lancaster,
    That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
    Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
    Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
    Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard
    Into the tumbling billows of the main.
    O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,
    What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,
    What sights of ugly death within my eyes!
    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,
    A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,
    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
    All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;
    Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes
    Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,
    As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
    That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep
    And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.
  KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death
    To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?
  CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive
    To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood
    Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth
    To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air;
    But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
    Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.
  KEEPER. Awak'd you not in this sore agony?
  CLARENCE. No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life.
    O, then began the tempest to my soul!
    I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood
    With that sour ferryman which poets write of,
    Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
    The first that there did greet my stranger soul
    Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
    Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury
    Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
    And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by
    A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
    Dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud
    'Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,
    That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury.
    Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!'
    With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
    Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears
    Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,
    I trembling wak'd, and for a season after
    Could not believe but that I was in hell,
    Such terrible impression made my dream.
  KEEPER. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
    I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
  CLARENCE. Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things
    That now give evidence against my soul
    For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!
    O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,
    But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,
    Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone;
    O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
  KEEPER, I prithee sit by me awhile;
    My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
  KEEPER. I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.
                                               [CLARENCE sleeps]

                  Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant

  BRAKENBURY. Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
    Makes the night morning and the noontide night.
    Princes have but their titles for their glories,
    An outward honour for an inward toil;
    And for unfelt imaginations
    They often feel a world of restless cares,
    So that between their tides and low name
    There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

                      Enter the two MURDERERS

  FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who's here?
  BRAKENBURY. What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st
    thou hither?
  FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came
    hither on my legs.
  BRAKENBURY. What, so brief?
  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let
    him see our commission and talk no more.
                                           [BRAKENBURY reads it]
  BRAKENBURY. I am, in this, commanded to deliver
    The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
    I will not reason what is meant hereby,
    Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
    There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.
    I'll to the King and signify to him
    That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.
  FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare
    you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
  SECOND MURDERER. What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?
  FIRST MURDERER. No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when
    he wakes.
  SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great
    judgment-day.
  FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him
    sleeping.
  SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath
    bred a kind of remorse in me.
  FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid?
  SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to
    be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can
    defend me.
  FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.
  SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live.
  FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and
    tell him so.
  SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this
    passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to
    hold me but while one tells twenty.
  FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou feel thyself now?
    SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
    are yet within me.
  FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's
    done.
  SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.
  FIRST MURDERER. Where's thy conscience now?
  SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse!
  FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our
    reward, thy conscience flies out.
  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or
    none will entertain it.
  FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to thee again?
  SECOND MURDERER. I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man
    coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man
    cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his
    neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-
    fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man
    full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
    that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.
    It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;
    and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
    to himself and live without it.
  FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,
    persuading me not to kill the Duke.
  SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe
    him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the
    sigh.
  FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with
    me.
  SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
    reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?
  FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of
    thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the
    next room.
  SECOND MURDERER. O excellent device! and make a sop of
    him.
  FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes.
  SECOND MURDERER. Strike!
  FIRST MURDERER. No, we'll reason with him.
  CLARENCE. Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.
  SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,
    anon.
  CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou?
  FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are.
  CLARENCE. But not as I am, royal.
  SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.
  CLARENCE. Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
  FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks
    mine own.
  CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
    Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?
    Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
  SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to-
  CLARENCE. To murder me?
  BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay.
  CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
    And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
    Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
  FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King.
  CLARENCE. I shall be reconcil'd to him again.
  SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
  CLARENCE. Are you drawn forth among a world of men
    To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
    Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
    What lawful quest have given their verdict up
    Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd
    The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
    Before I be convict by course of law,
    To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
    I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
    By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
    That you depart and lay no hands on me.
    The deed you undertake is damnable.
  FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.
  SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath commanded is our
    King.
  CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings
    Hath in the tables of his law commanded
    That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then
    Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
    Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand
    To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
  SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl
    on thee
    For false forswearing, and for murder too;
    Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
    In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
  FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God
    Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
    Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.
  SECOND MURDERER. Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
    defend.
  FIRST MURDERER. How canst thou urge God's dreadful law
    to us,
    When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?
  CLARENCE. Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
    For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
    He sends you not to murder me for this,
    For in that sin he is as deep as I.
    If God will be avenged for the deed,
    O, know you yet He doth it publicly.
    Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm;
    He needs no indirect or lawless course
    To cut off those that have offended Him.
  FIRST MURDERER. Who made thee then a bloody minister
    When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
    That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
  CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
  FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy
    faults,
    Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
  CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me;
    I am his brother, and I love him well.
    If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,
    And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
    Who shall reward you better for my life
    Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
  SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester
    hates you.
  CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.
    Go you to him from me.
  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we will.
  CLARENCE. Tell him when that our princely father York
    Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm
    And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,
    He little thought of this divided friendship.
    Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.
  CLARENCE. O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
  FIRST MURDERER. Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you
    deceive yourself:
    'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.
    CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune
    And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs
    That he would labour my delivery.
  FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
    From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
  SECOND MURDERER. Make peace with God, for you must die,
    my lord.
  CLARENCE. Have you that holy feeling in your souls
    To counsel me to make my peace with God,
    And are you yet to your own souls so blind
    That you will war with God by murd'ring me?
    O, sirs, consider: they that set you on
    To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
  SECOND MURDERER. What shall we do?
  CLARENCE. Relent, and save your souls.
  FIRST MURDERER. Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.
  CLARENCE. Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
    Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
    Being pent from liberty as I am now,
    If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
    Would not entreat for life?
    My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;
    O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
    Come thou on my side and entreat for me-
    As you would beg were you in my distress.
    A begging prince what beggar pities not?
  SECOND MURDERER. Look behind you, my lord.
  FIRST MURDERER.  [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all
    this will not do,
    I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
                                              Exit with the body
  SECOND MURDERER. A bloody deed, and desperately
    dispatch'd!
    How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
    Of this most grievous murder!

                       Re-enter FIRST MURDERER

  FIRST MURDERER-How now, what mean'st thou that thou
    help'st me not?
    By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have
    been!
  SECOND MURDERER. I would he knew that I had sav'd his
    brother!
    Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
    For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit
  FIRST MURDERER. So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
    Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,
    Till that the Duke give order for his burial;
    And when I have my meed, I will away;
    For this will out, and then I must not stay.            Exit


ACT2|SC1
                          ACT II. SCENE 1.

                         London. The palace
                    Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD sick,
               QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS,
                     BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others

  KING EDWARD. Why, so. Now have I done a good day's
    work.
    You peers, continue this united league.
    I every day expect an embassage
    From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
    And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven,
    Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.
    Hastings and Rivers, take each other's hand;
    Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
  RIVERS. By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;
    And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
  HASTINGS. So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
  KING EDWARD. Take heed you dally not before your king;
    Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
    Confound your hidden falsehood and award
    Either of you to be the other's end.
  HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
  RIVERS. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
  KING EDWARD. Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;
    Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you:
    You have been factious one against the other.
    Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
    And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There, Hastings; I will never more
    remember
    Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
  KING EDWARD. Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord
    Marquis.
  DORSET. This interchange of love, I here protest,
    Upon my part shall be inviolable.
  HASTINGS. And so swear I.                       [They embrace]
  KING EDWARD. Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this
    league
    With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
    And make me happy in your unity.
  BUCKINGHAM.  [To the QUEEN]  Whenever Buckingham
    doth turn his hate
    Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love
    Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
    With hate in those where I expect most love!
    When I have most need to employ a friend
    And most assured that he is a friend,
    Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
    Be he unto me! This do I beg of God
    When I am cold in love to you or yours.
                                                  [They embrace]
  KING EDWARD. A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
    Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
    There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
    To make the blessed period of this peace.
  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time,
    Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke.

                      Enter GLOUCESTER, and RATCLIFF

  GLOUCESTER. Good morrow to my sovereign king and
    Queen;
    And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
  KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
    Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
    Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
    Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
  GLOUCESTER. A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.
    Among this princely heap, if any here,
    By false intelligence or wrong surmise,
    Hold me a foe-
    If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
    Have aught committed that is hardly borne
    To any in this presence, I desire
    To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
    'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
    I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
    First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
    Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
    Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
    If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;
    Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,
    That all without desert have frown'd on me;
    Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;
    Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all.
    I do not know that Englishman alive
    With whom my soul is any jot at odds
    More than the infant that is born to-night.
    I thank my God for my humility.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
    I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
    My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
    To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
  GLOUCESTER. Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,
    To be so flouted in this royal presence?
    Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead?
                                                [They all start]
    You do him injury to scorn his corse.
  KING EDWARD. Who knows not he is dead! Who knows
    he is?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!
  BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
  DORSET. Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence
    But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
  KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.
  GLOUCESTER. But he, poor man, by your first order died,
    And that a winged Mercury did bear;
    Some tardy cripple bare the countermand
    That came too lag to see him buried.
    God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
    Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,
    Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
    And yet go current from suspicion!

                           Enter DERBY

  DERBY. A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
  KING EDWARD. I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.
  DERBY. I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.
  KING EDWARD. Then say at once what is it thou requests.
  DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
    Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman
    Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
  KING EDWARD. Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,
    And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
    My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,
    And yet his punishment was bitter death.
    Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,
    Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?
    Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
    Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
    The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
    Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury
    When Oxford had me down, he rescued me
    And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?
    Who told me, when we both lay in the field
    Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
    Even in his garments, and did give himself,
    All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
    All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
    Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
    Had so much race to put it in my mind.
    But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
    Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd
    The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
    You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
    And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.        [DERBY rises]
    But for my brother not a man would speak;
    Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
    For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
    Have been beholding to him in his life;
    Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
    O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
    On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!
    Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!
                                 Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN
  GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not
    How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
    Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
    O, they did urge it still unto the King!
    God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
    To comfort Edward with our company?
  BUCKINGHAM. We wait upon your Grace.                    Exeunt


ACT2|SC2
                              SCENE 2.

                         London. The palace
            Enter the old DUCHESS OF YORK, with the SON
                      and DAUGHTER of CLARENCE

  SON. Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?
  DUCHESS. No, boy.
  DAUGHTER. Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
    And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'?
  SON. Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
    And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
    If that our noble father were alive?
  DUCHESS. My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;
    I do lament the sickness of the King,
    As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
    It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
  SON. Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
    The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
    God will revenge it; whom I will importune
    With earnest prayers all to that effect.
  DAUGHTER. And so will I.
  DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you
    well.
    Incapable and shallow innocents,
    You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.
  SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
    Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen,
    Devis'd impeachments to imprison him.
    And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
    And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
    Bade me rely on him as on my father,
    And he would love me dearly as a child.
  DUCHESS. Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,
    And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!
    He is my son; ay, and therein my shame;
    Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
  SON. Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
  DUCHESS. Ay, boy.
  SON. I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?

            Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her
                ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her

  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and
    weep,
    To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
    I'll join with black despair against my soul
    And to myself become an enemy.
  DUCHESS. What means this scene of rude impatience?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To make an act of tragic violence.
  EDWARD, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.
    Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
    Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
    If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
    That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's,
    Or like obedient subjects follow him
    To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.
  DUCHESS. Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
    As I had title in thy noble husband!
    I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
    And liv'd with looking on his images;
    But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
    Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
    And I for comfort have but one false glass,
    That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
    Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother
    And hast the comfort of thy children left;
    But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms
    And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands-
    Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-
    Thine being but a moiety of my moan-
    To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?
  SON. Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!
    How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
  DAUGHTER. Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
    Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Give me no help in lamentation;
    I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
    All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
    That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
    May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
    Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!
  CHILDREN. Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!
  DUCHESS. Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What stay had I but Edward? and he's
    gone.
  CHILDREN. What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
  DUCHESS. What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Was never widow had so dear a loss.
  CHILDREN. Were never orphans had so dear a loss.
  DUCHESS. Was never mother had so dear a loss.
    Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!
    Their woes are parcell'd, mine is general.
    She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:
    I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.
    These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:
    I for an Edward weep, so do not they.
    Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,
    Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
    And I will pamper it with lamentation.
  DORSET. Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd
    That you take with unthankfulness his doing.
    In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful
    With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
    Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
    Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
    For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
  RIVERS. Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
    Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him;
    Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives.
    Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
    And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.

               Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY,
                      HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF

  GLOUCESTER. Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
    To wail the dimming of our shining star;
    But none can help our harms by wailing them.
    Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
    I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee
    I crave your blessing.
  DUCHESS. God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,
    Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
  GLOUCESTER. Amen!  [Aside]  And make me die a good old
    man!
    That is the butt end of a mother's blessing;
    I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.
  BUCKINGHAM. You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing
    peers,
    That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
    Now cheer each other in each other's love.
    Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
    We are to reap the harvest of his son.
    The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts,
    But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
    Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept.
    Me seemeth good that, with some little train,
    Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
    Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.

 RIVERS. Why with some little train, my Lord of
    Buckingham?
  BUCKINGHAM. Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude
    The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
    Which would be so much the more dangerous
    By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd;
    Where every horse bears his commanding rein
    And may direct his course as please himself,
    As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,
    In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
  GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us;
    And the compact is firm and true in me.
  RIVERS. And so in me; and so, I think, in an.
    Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
    To no apparent likelihood of breach,
    Which haply by much company might be urg'd;
    Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
    That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.
  HASTINGS. And so say I.
  GLOUCESTER. Then be it so; and go we to determine
    Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
    Madam, and you, my sister, will you go
    To give your censures in this business?
                        Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
    For God sake, let not us two stay at home;
    For by the way I'll sort occasion,
    As index to the story we late talk'd of,
    To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince.
  GLOUCESTER. My other self, my counsel's consistory,
    My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,
    I, as a child, will go by thy direction.
    Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.        Exeunt


ACT2|SC3
                               SCENE 3.

                           London. A street
                 Enter one CITIZEN at one door, and
                         another at the other

  FIRST CITIZEN. Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so
    fast?
  SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
    Hear you the news abroad?
  FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the
    better.
    I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.

                        Enter another CITIZEN

  THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God speed!
  FIRST CITIZEN. Give you good morrow, sir.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's
    death?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
  THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, look to see a troublous
    world.
  FIRST CITIZEN. No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall
    reign.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child.
  SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,
    Which, in his nonage, council under him,
    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,
    No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.
  FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
    Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends,
    God wot;
    For then this land was famously enrich'd
    With politic grave counsel; then the King
    Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Why, so hath this, both by his father and
    mother.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Better it were they all came by his father,
    Or by his father there were none at all;
    For emulation who shall now be nearest
    Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
    O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
    And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;
    And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,
    This sickly land might solace as before.
  FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be
    well.
  THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are seen, wise men put on
    their cloaks;
    When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;
    When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
    Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
    All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
    'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.
  SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.
    You cannot reason almost with a man
    That looks not heavily and fun of dread.
  THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so;
    By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
    Ensuing danger; as by proof we see
    The water swell before a boist'rous storm.
    But leave it all to God. Whither away?
  SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
  THIRD CITIZEN. And so was I; I'll bear you company.
                                                          Exeunt


ACT2|SC4
                            SCENE 4.

                        London. The palace
            Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young
                DUKE OF YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH,
                   and the DUCHESS OF YORK

  ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,
    And at Northampton they do rest to-night;
    To-morrow or next day they will be here.
  DUCHESS. I long with all my heart to see the Prince.
    I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But I hear no; they say my son of York
    Has almost overta'en him in his growth.
  YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
  DUCHESS. Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.
  YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
    My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
    More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester
    'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.'
    And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
    Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste.
  DUCHESS. Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
    In him that did object the same to thee.
    He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
    So long a-growing and so leisurely
    That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.
  ARCHBISHOP. And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.
  DUCHESS. I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
  YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,
    I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout
    To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
  DUCHESS. How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.
  YORK. Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
    That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.
    'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
    Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
  DUCHESS. I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?
  YORK. Grandam, his nurse.
  DUCHESS. His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast
    born.
  YORK. If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. A parlous boy! Go to, you are too
    shrewd.
  ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Pitchers have ears.

                        Enter a MESSENGER

  ARCHBISHOP. Here comes a messenger. What news?
  MESSENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince?
  MESSENGER. Well, madam, and in health.
  DUCHESS. What is thy news?
  MESSENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey
    Are sent to Pomfret, and with them
    Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
  DUCHESS. Who hath committed them?
  MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.
  ARCHBISHOP. For what offence?
  MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd.
    Why or for what the nobles were committed
    Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!
    The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;
    Insulting tyranny begins to jet
    Upon the innocent and aweless throne.
    Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!
    I see, as in a map, the end of all.
  DUCHESS. Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
    How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
    My husband lost his life to get the crown;
    And often up and down my sons were toss'd
    For me to joy and weep their gain and loss;
    And being seated, and domestic broils
    Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors
    Make war upon themselves-brother to brother,
    Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous
    And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,
    Or let me die, to look on death no more!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to
    sanctuary.
    Madam, farewell.
  DUCHESS. Stay, I will go with you.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. You have no cause.
  ARCHBISHOP.  [To the QUEEN]  My gracious lady, go.
    And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
    For my part, I'll resign unto your Grace
    The seal I keep; and so betide to me
    As well I tender you and all of yours!
    Go, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.                Exeunt


ACT3|SC1
                       ACT III. SCENE 1.

                       London. A street
          The trumpets sound. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES,
            GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, CARDINAL
                      BOURCHIER, and others

  BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your
    chamber.
  GLOUCESTER. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.
    The weary way hath made you melancholy.
  PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
    Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
    I want more uncles here to welcome me.
  GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your
    years
    Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit;
    Nor more can you distinguish of a man
    Than of his outward show; which, God He knows,
    Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
    Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
    Your Grace attended to their sug'red words
    But look'd not on the poison of their hearts.
    God keep you from them and from such false friends!
  PRINCE. God keep me from false friends! but they were
    none.
  GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet
    you.

                Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train

  MAYOR. God bless your Grace with health and happy days!
  PRINCE. I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.
    I thought my mother and my brother York
    Would long ere this have met us on the way.
    Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
    To tell us whether they will come or no!

                        Enter LORD HASTINGS

  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating
    Lord.
  PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?
  HASTINGS. On what occasion, God He knows, not I,
    The Queen your mother and your brother York
    Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince
    Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,
    But by his mother was perforce withheld.
  BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
    Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace
    Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
    Unto his princely brother presently?
    If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him
    And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
  CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
    Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
    Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
    To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
    We should infringe the holy privilege
    Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land
    Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
  BUCKINGHAM. You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
    Too ceremonious and traditional.
    Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
    You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
    The benefit thereof is always granted
    To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place
    And those who have the wit to claim the place.
    This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it,
    And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
    Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
    You break no privilege nor charter there.
    Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
    But sanctuary children never till now.
  CARDINAL. My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.
    Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
  HASTINGS. I go, my lord.
  PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
                                    Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
    Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
    Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
  GLOUCESTER. Where it seems best unto your royal self.
    If I may counsel you, some day or two
    Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower,
    Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
    For your best health and recreation.
  PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place.
    Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
  BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
    Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
  PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported
    Successively from age to age, he built it?
  BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord.
  PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not regist'red,
    Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,
    As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
    Even to the general all-ending day.
  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
    live long.
  PRINCE. What say you, uncle?
  GLOUCESTER. I say, without characters, fame lives long.
    [Aside]  Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
    I moralize two meanings in one word.
  PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
    With what his valour did enrich his wit,
    His wit set down to make his valour live.
    Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
    For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
    I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-
  BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?
  PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,
    I'll win our ancient right in France again,
    Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.
  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward
    spring.

              Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL

  BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of
    York.
  PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?
  YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now.
  PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
    Too late he died that might have kept that title,
    Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
  GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
  YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
    You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.
    The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
  GLOUCESTER. He hath, my lord.
  YORK. And therefore is he idle?
  GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
  YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.
  GLOUCESTER. He may command me as my sovereign;
    But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
  YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
  GLOUCESTER. My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!
  PRINCE. A beggar, brother?
  YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
    And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
  GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
  YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!
  GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.
  YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:
    In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
  GLOUCESTER. It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.
  YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
  GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, little
    Lord?
  YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
  GLOUCESTER. How?
  YORK. Little.
  PRINCE. My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.
    Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.
  YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.
    Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
    Because that I am little, like an ape,
    He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
  BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
    To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
    He prettily and aptly taunts himself.
    So cunning and so young is wonderful.
  GLOUCESTER. My lord, will't please you pass along?
    Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
    Will to your mother, to entreat of her
    To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
  YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
  PRINCE. My Lord Protector needs will have it so.
  YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
  GLOUCESTER. Why, what should you fear?
  YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.
    My grandam told me he was murder'd there.
  PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead.
  GLOUCESTER. Nor none that live, I hope.
  PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
    But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
    Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
    A sennet.
              Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY
  BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this little prating York
    Was not incensed by his subtle mother
    To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy;
    Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.
    He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
  BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
    Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
    As closely to conceal what we impart.
    Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way.
    What think'st thou? Is it not an easy matter
    To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
    For the instalment of this noble Duke
    In the seat royal of this famous isle?
  CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince
    That he will not be won to aught against him.
  BUCKINGHAM. What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will
    not he?
  CATESBY. He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
  BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle
    Catesby,
    And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
    How he doth stand affected to our purpose;
    And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
    To sit about the coronation.
    If thou dost find him tractable to us,
    Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;
    If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,
    Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,
    And give us notice of his inclination;
    For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
    Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
  GLOUCESTER. Commend me to Lord William. Tell him,
    Catesby,
    His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
    To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;
    And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
    Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
  BUCKINGHAM. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.
  CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can.
  GLOUCESTER. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
  CATESBY. You shall, my lord.
  GLOUCESTER. At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.
                                                    Exit CATESBY
  BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we
    perceive
    Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
  GLOUCESTER. Chop off his head-something we will
    determine.
    And, look when I am King, claim thou of me
    The earldom of Hereford and all the movables
    Whereof the King my brother was possess'd.
  BUCKINGHAM. I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.
  GLOUCESTER. And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
    Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
    We may digest our complots in some form.              Exeunt


ACT3|SC2
                             SCENE 2.

                    Before LORD HASTING'S house
             Enter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS

  MESSENGER. My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]
  HASTINGS.  [Within]  Who knocks?
  MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.
  HASTINGS.  [Within]  What is't o'clock?
  MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.

                        Enter LORD HASTINGS

  HASTINGS. Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious
    nights?
  MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say.
    First, he commends him to your noble self.
  HASTINGS. What then?
  MESSENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night
    He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.
    Besides, he says there are two councils kept,
    And that may be determin'd at the one
    Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.
    Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure-
    If you will presently take horse with him
    And with all speed post with him toward the north
    To shun the danger that his soul divines.
  HASTINGS. Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
    Bid him not fear the separated council:
    His honour and myself are at the one,
    And at the other is my good friend Catesby;
    Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
    Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
    Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;
    And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple
    To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.
    To fly the boar before the boar pursues
    Were to incense the boar to follow us
    And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
    Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;
    And we will both together to the Tower,
    Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
  MESSENGER. I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.
                                                            Exit

                         Enter CATESBY

  CATESBY. Many good morrows to my noble lord!
  HASTINGS. Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.
    What news, what news, in this our tott'ring state?
  CATESBY. It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;
    And I believe will never stand upright
    Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
  HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the
    crown?
  CATESBY. Ay, my good lord.
  HASTINGS. I'll have this crown of mine cut from my
    shoulders
    Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.
    But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
  CATESBY. Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
    Upon his party for the gain thereof;
    And thereupon he sends you this good news,
    That this same very day your enemies,
    The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.
  HASTINGS. Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
    Because they have been still my adversaries;
    But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side
    To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
    God knows I will not do it to the death.
  CATESBY. God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
  HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
    That they which brought me in my master's hate,
    I live to look upon their tragedy.
    Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
    I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.
  CATESBY. 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
    When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
  HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
    With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do
    With some men else that think themselves as safe
    As thou and I, who, as thou knowest, are dear
    To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
  CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you-
    [Aside]  For they account his head upon the bridge.
  HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have well deserv'd it.

                      Enter LORD STANLEY

    Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
    Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
  STANLEY. My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby.
    You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
    I do not like these several councils, I.
  HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,
    And never in my days, I do protest,
    Was it so precious to me as 'tis now.
    Think you, but that I know our state secure,
    I would be so triumphant as I am?
  STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from
    London,
    Were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure,
    And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
    But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.
    This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;
    Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.
    What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.
  HASTINGS. Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my
    Lord?
    To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded.
  STANLEY. They, for their truth, might better wear their
    heads
    Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats.
    But come, my lord, let's away.

                 Enter HASTINGS, a pursuivant

  HASTINGS. Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
                                      Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
    How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee?
  PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask.
  HASTINGS. I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
    Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet:
    Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
    By the suggestion of the Queen's allies;
    But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-
    This day those enernies are put to death,
    And I in better state than e'er I was.
  PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour's good content!
  HASTINGS. Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me.
                                          [Throws him his purse]
  PURSUIVANT. I thank your honour.                          Exit

                            Enter a PRIEST

  PRIEST. Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
  HASTINGS. I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
    I am in your debt for your last exercise;
    Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
                                        [He whispers in his ear]
  PRIEST. I'll wait upon your lordship.

                            Enter BUCKINGHAM

  BUCKINGHAM. What, talking with a priest, Lord
    Chamberlain!
    Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:
    Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
  HASTINGS. Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
    The men you talk of came into my mind.
    What, go you toward the Tower?
  BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;
    I shall return before your lordship thence.
  HASTINGS. Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.
  BUCKINGHAM.  [Aside]  And supper too, although thou
    knowest it not.-
    Come, will you go?
  HASTINGS. I'll wait upon your lordship.                 Exeunt


ACT3|SC3
                              SCENE 3.

                           Pomfret Castle
            Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds,
          carrying the Nobles, RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN,
                            to death

  RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
    To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
    For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
  GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
    A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.
  VAUGHAN. You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.
  RATCLIFF. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
  RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
    Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
    Within the guilty closure of thy walls
  RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death;
    And for more slander to thy dismal seat,
    We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.
  GREY. Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
    When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I,
    For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
  RIVERS. Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she
    Buckingham,
    Then curs'd she Hastings. O, remember, God,
    To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!
    And for my sister, and her princely sons,
    Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
    Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
  RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
  RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.
    Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.              Exeunt


ACT3|SC4
                             SCENE 4

                        London. The Tower
           Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP
           of ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others and seat
                     themselves at a table

  HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met
    Is to determine of the coronation.
    In God's name speak-when is the royal day?
  BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for the royal time?
  DERBY. It is, and wants but nomination.
  BISHOP OF ELY. To-morrow then I judge a happy day.
  BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind
    herein?
    Who is most inward with the noble Duke?
  BISHOP OF ELY. Your Grace, we think, should soonest know
    his mind.
  BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts,
    He knows no more of mine than I of yours;
    Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.
    Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
  HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
    But for his purpose in the coronation
    I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
    His gracious pleasure any way therein.
    But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;
    And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
    Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.

                       Enter GLOUCESTER

  BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.
  GLOUCESTER. My noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.
    I have been long a sleeper, but I trust
    My absence doth neglect no great design
    Which by my presence might have been concluded.
  BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,
  WILLIAM Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part-
    I mean, your voice for crowning of the King.
  GLOUCESTER. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be
    bolder;
    His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
    My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn
    I saw good strawberries in your garden there.
    I do beseech you send for some of them.
  BISHOP of ELY. Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.
                                                            Exit
  GLOUCESTER. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
                                               [Takes him aside]
    Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
    And finds the testy gentleman so hot
    That he will lose his head ere give consent
    His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,
    Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
  BUCKINGHAM. Withdraw yourself awhile; I'll go with you.
                                Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
  DERBY. We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
    To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;
    For I myself am not so well provided
    As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.

                    Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY

  BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?
    I have sent for these strawberries.
  HASTINGS. His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this
    morning;
    There's some conceit or other likes him well
    When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
    I think there's never a man in Christendom
    Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;
    For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
  DERBY. What of his heart perceive you in his face
    By any livelihood he show'd to-day?
  HASTINGS. Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
    For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.

               Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM

  GLOUCESTER. I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
    That do conspire my death with devilish plots
    Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
    Upon my body with their hellish charms?
  HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
    Makes me most forward in this princely presence
    To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be.
    I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
  GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
    Look how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm
    Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up.
    And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
    Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
    That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
  HASTINGS. If they have done this deed, my noble lord-
  GLOUCESTER. If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,
    Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.
    Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear
    I will not dine until I see the same.
    Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done.
    The rest that love me, rise and follow me.
                    Exeunt all but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF
  HASTINGS. Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;
    For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
  STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms,
    And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.
    Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
    And started when he look'd upon the Tower,
    As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
    O, now I need the priest that spake to me!
    I now repent I told the pursuivant,
    As too triumphing, how mine enemies
    To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
    And I myself secure in grace and favour.
    O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
    Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
  RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at
    dinner.
    Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
  HASTINGS. O momentary grace of mortal men,
    Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
    Who builds his hope in air of your good looks
    Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
    Ready with every nod to tumble down
    Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
  LOVEL. Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
  HASTINGS. O bloody Richard! Miserable England!
    I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee
    That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
    Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
    They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt


ACT3|SC5
                             SCENE 5.

                    London. The Tower-walls
           Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten
                armour, marvellous ill-favoured

  GLOUCESTER. Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change
    thy colour,
    Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
    And then again begin, and stop again,
    As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?
  BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
    Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
    Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
    Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks
    Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
    And both are ready in their offices
    At any time to grace my stratagems.
    But what, is Catesby gone?
  GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.

                 Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY

  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor-
  GLOUCESTER. Look to the drawbridge there!
  BUCKINGHAM. Hark! a drum.
  GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-
  GLOUCESTER. Look back, defend thee; here are enemies.
  BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!

           Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head

  GLOUCESTER. Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.
  LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
    The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
  GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.
    I took him for the plainest harmless creature
    That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;
    Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
    The history of all her secret thoughts.
    So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue
    That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
    I mean his conversation with Shore's wife-
    He liv'd from all attainder of suspects.
  BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red
    traitor
    That ever liv'd.
    Would you imagine, or almost believe-
    Were't not that by great preservation
    We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor
    This day had plotted, in the council-house,
    To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester.
  MAYOR. Had he done so?
  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?
    Or that we would, against the form of law,
    Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death
    But that the extreme peril of the case,
    The peace of England and our persons' safety,
    Enforc'd us to this execution?
  MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;
    And your good Graces both have well proceeded
    To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
    I never look'd for better at his hands
    After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
  BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die
    Until your lordship came to see his end-
    Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
    Something against our meanings, have prevented-
    Because, my lord, I would have had you heard
    The traitor speak, and timorously confess
    The manner and the purpose of his treasons:
    That you might well have signified the same
    Unto the citizens, who haply may
    Misconster us in him and wail his death.
  MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve
    As well as I had seen and heard him speak;
    And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,
    But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
    With all your just proceedings in this cause.
  GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,
    T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world.
  BUCKINGHAM. Which since you come too late of our intent,
    Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
    And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.
                                                 Exit LORD MAYOR
  GLOUCESTER. Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
    The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post.
    There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
    Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.
    Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
    Only for saying he would make his son
    Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,
    Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
    Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
    And bestial appetite in change of lust,
    Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,
    Even where his raging eye or savage heart
    Without control lusted to make a prey.
    Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
    Tell them, when that my mother went with child
    Of that insatiate Edward, noble York
    My princely father then had wars in France
    And, by true computation of the time,
    Found that the issue was not his begot;
    Which well appeared in his lineaments,
    Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.
    Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;
    Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.
  BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator
    As if the golden fee for which I plead
    Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.
  GLOUCESTER. If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's
    Castle;
    Where you shall find me well accompanied
    With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.
  BUCKINGHAM. I go; and towards three or four o'clock
    Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.           Exit
  GLOUCESTER. Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.
    [To CATESBY]  Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both
    Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
    Now will I go to take some privy order
    To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,
    And to give order that no manner person
    Have any time recourse unto the Princes.                Exit


ACT3|SC6
                            SCENE 6.

                        London. A street
                       Enter a SCRIVENER

  SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
    Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd
    That it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's.
    And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
    Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,
    For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;
    The precedent was full as long a-doing;
    And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,
    Untainted, unexamin'd, free, at liberty.
    Here's a good world the while! Who is so gros
    That cannot see this palpable device?
    Yet who's so bold but says he sees it not?
    Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
    When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.          Exit
ACT3|SC7
                            SCENE 7.

                     London. Baynard's Castle
        Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors

  GLOUCESTER. How now, how now! What say the citizens?
  BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord,
    The citizens are mum, say not a word.
  GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's
    children?
  BUCKINGHAM. I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
    And his contract by deputy in France;
    Th' insatiate greediness of his desire,
    And his enforcement of the city wives;
    His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
    As being got, your father then in France,
    And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.
    Withal I did infer your lineaments,
    Being the right idea of your father,
    Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
    Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
    Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
    Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
    Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
    Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse.
    And when mine oratory drew toward end
    I bid them that did love their country's good
    Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal King!'
  GLOUCESTER. And did they so?
  BUCKINGHAM. No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
    But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
    Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
    Which when I saw, I reprehended them,
    And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence.
    His answer was, the people were not used
    To be spoke to but by the Recorder.
    Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again.
    'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-
    But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
    When he had done, some followers of mine own
    At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps,
    And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
    And thus I took the vantage of those few-
    'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I
    'This general applause and cheerful shout
    Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.'
    And even here brake off and came away.
  GLOUCESTER. What, tongueless blocks were they? Would
    they not speak?
    Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?
  BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;
    Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit;
    And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
    And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;
    For on that ground I'll make a holy descant;
    And be not easily won to our requests.
    Play the maid's part: still answer nay, and take it.
  GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as well for them
    As I can say nay to thee for myself,
    No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.
  BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor
    knocks.                                      Exit GLOUCESTER

           Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens

    Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here;
    I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.

                         Enter CATESBY

    Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?
  CATESBY. He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,
    To visit him to-morrow or next day.
    He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
    Divinely bent to meditation;
    And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,
    To draw him from his holy exercise.
  BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;
    Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen,
    In deep designs, in matter of great moment,
    No less importing than our general good,
    Are come to have some conference with his Grace.
  CATESBY. I'll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit
  BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
    He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,
    But on his knees at meditation;
    Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
    But meditating with two deep divines;
    Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
    But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
    Happy were England would this virtuous prince
    Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof;
    But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it.
  MAYOR. Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!
  BUCKINGHAM. I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.

                          Re-enter CATESBY

    Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?
  CATESBY. My lord,
    He wonders to what end you have assembled
    Such troops of citizens to come to him.
    His Grace not being warn'd thereof before,
    He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.
  BUCKINGHAM. Sorry I am my noble cousin should
    Suspect me that I mean no good to him.
    By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;
    And so once more return and tell his Grace.
                                                    Exit CATESBY
    When holy and devout religious men
    Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence,
    So sweet is zealous contemplation.

           Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two BISHOPS.
                      CATESBY returns

  MAYOR. See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!
  BUCKINGHAM. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
    To stay him from the fall of vanity;
    And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
    True ornaments to know a holy man.
    Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince,
    Lend favourable ear to our requests,
    And pardon us the interruption
    Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
  GLOUCESTER. My lord, there needs no such apology:
    I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
    Who, earnest in the service of my God,
    Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.
    But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?
  BUCKINGHAM. Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
    And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
  GLOUCESTER. I do suspect I have done some offence
    That seems disgracious in the city's eye,
    And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
  BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please
    your Grace,
    On our entreaties, to amend your fault!
  GLOUCESTER. Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
  BUCKINGHAM. Know then, it is your fault that you resign
    The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
    The scept'red office of your ancestors,
    Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
    The lineal glory of your royal house,
    To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;
    Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
    Which here we waken to our country's good,
    The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
    Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,
    Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
    And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf
    Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.
    Which to recure, we heartily solicit
    Your gracious self to take on you the charge
    And kingly government of this your land-
    Not as protector, steward, substitute,
    Or lowly factor for another's gain;
    But as successively, from blood to blood,
    Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
    For this, consorted with the citizens,
    Your very worshipful and loving friends,
    And by their vehement instigation,
    In this just cause come I to move your Grace.
  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell if to depart in silence
    Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
    Best fitteth my degree or your condition.
    If not to answer, you might haply think
    Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
    To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
    Which fondly you would here impose on me;
    If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
    So season'd with your faithful love to me,
    Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.
    Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first,
    And then, in speaking, not to incur the last-
    Definitively thus I answer you:
    Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
    Unmeritable shuns your high request.
    First, if all obstacles were cut away,
    And that my path were even to the crown,
    As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
    Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
    So mighty and so many my defects,
    That I would rather hide me from my greatness-
    Being a bark to brook no mighty sea-
    Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
    And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
    But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me-
    And much I need to help you, were there need.
    The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
    Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
    Will well become the seat of majesty
    And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
    On him I lay that you would lay on me-
    The right and fortune of his happy stars,
    Which God defend that I should wring from him.
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, this argues conscience in your
    Grace;
    But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
    All circumstances well considered.
    You say that Edward is your brother's son.
    So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
    For first was he contract to Lady Lucy-
    Your mother lives a witness to his vow-
    And afterward by substitute betroth'd
    To Bona, sister to the King of France.
    These both put off, a poor petitioner,
    A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,
    A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
    Even in the afternoon of her best days,
    Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,
    Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree
    To base declension and loath'd bigamy.
    By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
    This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.
    More bitterly could I expostulate,
    Save that, for reverence to some alive,
    I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
    Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
    This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
    If not to bless us and the land withal,
    Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
    From the corruption of abusing times
    Unto a lineal true-derived course.
  MAYOR. Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.
  BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
  CATESBY. O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
  GLOUCESTER. Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
    I am unfit for state and majesty.
    I do beseech you, take it not amiss:
    I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
  BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,
    Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;
    As well we know your tenderness of heart
    And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
    Which we have noted in you to your kindred
    And egally indeed to all estates-
    Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,
    Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
    But we will plant some other in the throne
    To the disgrace and downfall of your house;
    And in this resolution here we leave you.
    Come, citizens. Zounds, I'll entreat no more.
  GLOUCESTER. O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, MAYOR, and citizens
  CATESBY. Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit.
    If you deny them, all the land will rue it.
  GLOUCESTER. Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
    Call them again. I am not made of stones,
    But penetrable to your kind entreaties,
    Albeit against my conscience and my soul.

                  Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest

    Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,
    Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
    To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,
    I must have patience to endure the load;
    But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach
    Attend the sequel of your imposition,
    Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
    From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
    For God doth know, and you may partly see,
    How far I am from the desire of this.
  MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.
  GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
  BUCKINGHAM. Then I salute you with this royal title-
    Long live King Richard, England's worthy King!
  ALL. Amen.
  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?
  GLOUCESTER. Even when you please, for you will have it so.
  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;
    And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.
  GLOUCESTER.  [To the BISHOPS]  Come, let us to our holy
    work again.
    Farewell, my cousin; farewell, gentle friends.        Exeunt


ACT4|SC1
                          ACT IV. SCENE 1.

                      London. Before the Tower
             Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS of YORK, and
            MARQUIS of DORSET, at one door; ANNE, DUCHESS
                of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET
               PLANTAGENET, CLARENCE's young daughter,
                         at another door

  DUCHESS. Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet,
    Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
    Now, for my life, she's wand'ring to the Tower,
    On pure heart's love, to greet the tender Princes.
    Daughter, well met.
  ANNE. God give your Graces both
    A happy and a joyful time of day!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As much to you, good sister! Whither
    away?
  ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
    Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
    To gratulate the gentle Princes there.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we'll enter
    all together.

                       Enter BRAKENBURY

    And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
    Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
    How doth the Prince, and my young son of York?
  BRAKENBURY. Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
    I may not suffer you to visit them.
    The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The King! Who's that?
  BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly
    title!
    Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
    I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?
  DUCHESS. I am their father's mother; I will see them.
  ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.
    Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,
    And take thy office from thee on my peril.
  BRAKENBURY. No, madam, no. I may not leave it so;
    I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.            Exit

                         Enter STANLEY

  STANLEY. Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
    And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother
    And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
    [To ANNE]  Come, madam, you must straight to
    Westminster,
    There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, cut my lace asunder
    That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
    Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!
  ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
  DORSET. Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee
    gone!
    Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;
    Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
    If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
    And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
    Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
    Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
    And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
    Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
  STANLEY. Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
    Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
    You shall have letters from me to my son
    In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
    Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
  DUCHESS. O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
    O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
    A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
    Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
  STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
  ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go.
    O, would to God that the inclusive verge
    Of golden metal that must round my brow
    Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains!
    Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
    And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen!'
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory.
    To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
  ANNE. No, why? When he that is my husband now
    Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;
    When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
    Which issued from my other angel husband,
    And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd-
    O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
    This was my wish: 'Be thou' quoth I 'accurs'd
    For making me, so young, so old a widow;
    And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
    And be thy wife, if any be so mad,
    More miserable by the life of thee
    Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.'
    Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
    Within so small a time, my woman's heart
    Grossly grew captive to his honey words
    And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse,
    Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;
    For never yet one hour in his bed
    Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
    But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.
    Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
    And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
  ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.
  DORSET. Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!
  ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!
  DUCHESS.  [To DORSET]  Go thou to Richmond, and good
    fortune guide thee!
    [To ANNE]  Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend
    thee!  [To QUEEN ELIZABETH]  Go thou to sanctuary, and good
    thoughts possess thee!
    I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
    Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
    And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Stay, yet look back with me unto the
    Tower.
    Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
    Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls,
    Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.
    Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
    For tender princes, use my babies well.
    So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.         Exeunt

                            SCENE 2.

                       London. The palace
         Sound a sennet. Enter RICHARD, in pomp, as KING;
           BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, a PAGE,
                           and others

  KING RICHARD. Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham!
  BUCKINGHAM. My gracious sovereign?
  KING RICHARD. Give me thy hand.
                           [Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound]
    Thus high, by thy advice
    And thy assistance, is King Richard seated.
    But shall we wear these glories for a day;
    Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
  BUCKINGHAM. Still live they, and for ever let them last!
  KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
    To try if thou be current gold indeed.
    Young Edward lives-think now what I would speak.
  BUCKINGHAM. Say on, my loving lord.
  KING RICHARD. Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King.
  BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.
  KING RICHARD. Ha! am I King? 'Tis so; but Edward lives.
  BUCKINGHAM. True, noble Prince.
  KING RICHARD. O bitter consequence:
    That Edward still should live-true noble Prince!
    Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
    Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead.
    And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
    What say'st thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief.
  BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace may do your pleasure.
  KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.
    Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
  BUCKINGHAM. Give me some little breath, some pause,
    dear Lord,
    Before I positively speak in this.
    I will resolve you herein presently.                    Exit
  CATESBY.  [Aside to another]  The King is angry; see, he
    gnaws his lip.
  KING RICHARD. I will converse with iron-witted fools
                                      [Descends from the throne]
    And unrespective boys; none are for me
    That look into me with considerate eyes.
    High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
    Boy!
  PAGE. My lord?
  KING RICHARD. Know'st thou not any whom corrupting
    gold
    Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?
  PAGE. I know a discontented gentleman
    Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
    Gold were as good as twenty orators,
    And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.
  KING RICHARD. What is his name?
  PAGE. His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
  KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, call him hither,
    boy.                                               Exit PAGE
    The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
    No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.
    Hath he so long held out with me, untir'd,
    And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.

                            Enter STANLEY

    How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news?
  STANLEY. Know, my loving lord,
    The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled
    To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.    [Stands apart]
  KING RICHARD. Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad
    That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;
    I will take order for her keeping close.
    Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
    Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter-
    The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
    Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
    That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.
    About it; for it stands me much upon
    To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
                                                    Exit CATESBY
    I must be married to my brother's daughter,
    Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
    Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
    Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
    So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
    Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

                     Re-enter PAGE, with TYRREL

    Is thy name Tyrrel?
  TYRREL. James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
  KING RICHARD. Art thou, indeed?
  TYRREL. Prove me, my gracious lord.
  KING RICHARD. Dar'st'thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
  TYRREL. Please you;
    But I had rather kill two enemies.
  KING RICHARD. Why, then thou hast it. Two deep enemies,
    Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,
    Are they that I would have thee deal upon.
  TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
  TYRREL. Let me have open means to come to them,
    And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
  KING RICHARD. Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come
    hither, Tyrrel.
    Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.      [Whispers]
    There is no more but so: say it is done,
    And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.
  TYRREL. I will dispatch it straight.                      Exit

                    Re-enter BUCKINGHAM

    BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I have consider'd in my mind
    The late request that you did sound me in.
  KING RICHARD. Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to
    Richmond.
  BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look
    unto it.
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,
    For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd:
    Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables
    Which you have promised I shall possess.
  KING RICHARD. Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
    Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
  BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highness to my just request?
  KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth
    Did prophesy that Richmond should be King,
    When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
    A king!-perhaps-
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-
  KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that
    time
    Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom-
  KING RICHARD. Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
    The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle
    And call'd it Rugemount, at which name I started,
    Because a bard of Ireland told me once
    I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-
  KING RICHARD. Ay, what's o'clock?
  BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
    Of what you promis'd me.
  KING RICHARD. Well, but o'clock?
  BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten.
  KING RICHARD. Well, let it strike.
  BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike?
  KING RICHARD. Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the
    stroke
    Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
    I am not in the giving vein to-day.
  BUCKINGHAM. May it please you to resolve me in my suit.
  KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.
                                       Exeunt all but Buckingham
  BUCKINGHAM. And is it thus? Repays he my deep service
    With such contempt? Made I him King for this?
    O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
    To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!               Exit


ACT4|SC3
                              SCENE 3.

                         London. The palace
                            Enter TYRREL

  TYRREL. The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
    The most arch deed of piteous massacre
    That ever yet this land was guilty of.
    Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn
    To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
    Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
    Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
    Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.
    'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'-
    'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another
    Within their alabaster innocent arms.
    Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
    And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
    A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
    Which once,' quoth Forrest 'almost chang'd my mind;
    But, O, the devil'-there the villain stopp'd;
    When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
    The most replenished sweet work of nature
    That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
    Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
    They could not speak; and so I left them both,
    To bear this tidings to the bloody King.

                        Enter KING RICHARD

    And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!
  KING RICHARD. Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
  TYRREL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge
    Beget your happiness, be happy then,
    For it is done.
  KING RICHARD. But didst thou see them dead?
  TYRREL. I did, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
  TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
    But where, to say the truth, I do not know.
  KING RICHARD. Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
    When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
    Meantime, but think how I may do thee good
    And be inheritor of thy desire.
    Farewell till then.
  TYRREL. I humbly take my leave.                           Exit
  KING RICHARD. The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
    His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
    The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
    And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.
    Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims
    At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
    And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,
    To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.

                           Enter RATCLIFF

  RATCLIFF. My lord!
  KING RICHARD. Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so
    bluntly?
  RATCLIFF. Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond;
    And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
    Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
  KING RICHARD. Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
    Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
    Come, I have learn'd that fearful commenting
    Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
    Delay leads impotent and snail-pac'd beggary.
    Then fiery expedition be my wing,
    Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
    Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield.
    We must be brief when traitors brave the field.       Exeunt


ACT4|SC4
                           SCENE 4.

                  London. Before the palace
                  Enter old QUEEN MARGARET

  QUEEN MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mellow
    And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
    Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd
    To watch the waning of mine enemies.
    A dire induction am I witness to,
    And will to France, hoping the consequence
    Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
    Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?
                                                       [Retires]

           Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK

  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, my poor princes! ah, my tender
    babes!
    My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
    If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
    And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
    Hover about me with your airy wings
    And hear your mother's lamentation.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Hover about her; say that right for right
    Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
  DUCHESS. So many miseries have craz'd my voice
    That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
    Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
  QUEEN MARGARET. Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet,
    Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle
    lambs
    And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
    When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
  QUEEN MARGARET. When holy Harry died, and my sweet
    son.
  DUCHESS. Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,
    Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
    Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
    Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,    [Sitting down]
    Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a
    grave
    As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
    Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
    Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?
                                           [Sitting down by her]
  QUEEN MARGARET.  [Coming forward]  If ancient sorrow be
    most reverend,
    Give mine the benefit of seniory,
    And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
    If sorrow can admit society,        [Sitting down with them]
    Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine.
    I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
    I had a husband, till a Richard kill'd him:
    Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
    Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.
  DUCHESS. I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
    I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard
    kill'd him.
    From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
    A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.
    That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes
    To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
    That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
    That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
    That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
    Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.
    O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
    How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
    Preys on the issue of his mother's body
    And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
  DUCHESS. O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
    God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
  QUEEN MARGARET. Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
    And now I cloy me with beholding it.
    Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward;
    The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
    Young York he is but boot, because both they
    Match'd not the high perfection of my loss.
    Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward;
    And the beholders of this frantic play,
    Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
    Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
    Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer;
    Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls
    And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,
    Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.
    Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
    To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.
    Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,
    That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.'
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would
      come
    That I should wish for thee to help me curse
    That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
  QUEEN MARGARET. I Call'd thee then vain flourish of my
      fortune;
    I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen,
    The presentation of but what I was,
    The flattering index of a direful pageant,
    One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below,
    A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,
    A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
    To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
    A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,
    A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
    Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?
    Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?
    Who sues, and kneels, and says 'God save the Queen'?
    Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?
    Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?
    Decline an this, and see what now thou art:
    For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
    For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
    For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues;
    For Queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
    For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
    For she being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
    For she commanding all, obey'd of none.
    Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about
    And left thee but a very prey to time,
    Having no more but thought of what thou wast
    To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
    Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
    Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
    Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke,
    From which even here I slip my weary head
    And leave the burden of it all on thee.
    Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance;
    These English woes shall make me smile in France.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile
    And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
  QUEEN MARGARET. Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the
      days;
    Compare dead happiness with living woe;
    Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,
    And he that slew them fouler than he is.
    Bett'ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse;
    Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My words are dull; O, quicken them
    with thine!
  QUEEN MARGARET. Thy woes will make them sharp and
    pierce like mine.                                       Exit
  DUCHESS. Why should calamity be fun of words?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Windy attorneys to their client woes,
    Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
    Poor breathing orators of miseries,
    Let them have scope; though what they will impart
    Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart.
  DUCHESS. If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,
    And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
    My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd.
    The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims.

         Enter KING RICHARD and his train, marching with
                     drums and trumpets

  KING RICHARD. Who intercepts me in my expedition?
  DUCHESS. O, she that might have intercepted thee,
    By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
    From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Hidest thou that forehead with a golden
    crown
    Where't should be branded, if that right were right,
    The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown,
    And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
    Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
  DUCHESS. Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother
    Clarence?
    And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan,
    Grey?
  DUCHESS. Where is kind Hastings?
  KING RICHARD. A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!
    Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
    Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say!
                                             [Flourish. Alarums]
    Either be patient and entreat me fair,
    Or with the clamorous report of war
    Thus will I drown your exclamations.
  DUCHESS. Art thou my son?
  KING RICHARD. Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
  DUCHESS. Then patiently hear my impatience.
  KING RICHARD. Madam, I have a touch of your condition
    That cannot brook the accent of reproof.
  DUCHESS. O, let me speak!
  KING RICHARD. Do, then; but I'll not hear.
  DUCHESS. I will be mild and gentle in my words.
  KING RICHARD. And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
  DUCHESS. Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
    God knows, in torment and in agony.
  KING RICHARD. And came I not at last to comfort you?
  DUCHESS. No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well
    Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell.
    A grievous burden was thy birth to me;
    Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
    Thy school-days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and furious;
    Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
    Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,
    More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred.
    What comfortable hour canst thou name
    That ever grac'd me with thy company?
  KING RICHARD. Faith, none but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
    your Grace
    To breakfast once forth of my company.
    If I be so disgracious in your eye,
    Let me march on and not offend you, madam.
    Strike up the drum.
  DUCHESS. I prithee hear me speak.
  KING RICHARD. You speak too bitterly.
  DUCHESS. Hear me a word;
    For I shall never speak to thee again.
  KING RICHARD. So.
  DUCHESS. Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance
    Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror;
    Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
    And never more behold thy face again.
    Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,
    Which in the day of battle tire thee more
    Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
    My prayers on the adverse party fight;
    And there the little souls of Edward's children
    Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
    And promise them success and victory.
    Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.
    Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.        Exit
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Though far more cause, yet much less
      spirit to curse
    Abides in me; I say amen to her.
  KING RICHARD. Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I have no moe sons of the royal blood
    For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,
    They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
    And therefore level not to hit their lives.
  KING RICHARD. You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth.
    Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And must she die for this? O, let her
      live,
    And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,
    Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,
    Throw over her the veil of infamy;
    So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
    I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
  KING RICHARD. Wrong not her birth; she is a royal
    Princess.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To save her life I'll say she is not so.
  KING RICHARD. Her life is safest only in her birth.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And only in that safety died her
      brothers.
  KING RICHARD. Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, to their lives ill friends were
      contrary.
  KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. True, when avoided grace makes destiny.
    My babes were destin'd to a fairer death,
    If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
  KING RICHARD. You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle
      cozen'd
    Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
    Whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts,
    Thy head, an indirectly, gave direction.
    No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt
    Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart
    To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
    But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame,
    My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
    Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
    And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,
    Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
    Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
  KING RICHARD. Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
    And dangerous success of bloody wars,
    As I intend more good to you and yours
    Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd!
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What good is cover'd with the face of
      heaven,
    To be discover'd, that can do me good?
  KING RICHARD. advancement of your children, gentle
    lady.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Up to some scaffold, there to lose their
    heads?
  KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of Fortune,
    The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Flatter my sorrow with report of it;
    Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
    Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
  KING RICHARD. Even all I have-ay, and myself and all
    Will I withal endow a child of thine;
    So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
    Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
    Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the process of thy
      kindness
    Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
  KING RICHARD. Then know, that from my soul I love thy
    daughter.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My daughter's mother thinks it with her
    soul.
  KING RICHARD. What do you think?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from
      thy soul.
    So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,
    And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
  KING RICHARD. Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.
    I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
    And do intend to make her Queen of England.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be
    her king?
  KING RICHARD. Even he that makes her Queen. Who else
    should be?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What, thou?
  KING RICHARD. Even so. How think you of it?
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How canst thou woo her?
  KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you,
    As one being best acquainted with her humour.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And wilt thou learn of me?
  KING RICHARD. Madam, with all my heart.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her
    brothers,
    A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
    'Edward' and 'York.' Then haply will she weep;
    Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret
    Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood-
    A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
    The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,
    And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
    If this inducement move her not to love,
    Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;
    Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,
    Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake
    Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
  KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way
    To win your daughter.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There is no other way;
    Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
    And not be Richard that hath done all this.
  KING RICHARD. Say that I did all this for love of her.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but
      hate thee,
    Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
  KING RICHARD. Look what is done cannot be now amended.
    Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
    Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.
    If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
    To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.
    If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
    To quicken your increase I will beget
    Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.
    A grandam's name is little less in love
    Than is the doating title of a mother;
    They are as children but one step below,
    Even of your metal, of your very blood;
    Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
    Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
    Your children were vexation to your youth;
    But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
    The loss you have is but a son being King,
    And by that loss your daughter is made Queen.
    I cannot make you what amends I would,
    Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
    Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
    Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
    This fair alliance quickly shall can home
    To high promotions and great dignity.
    The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
    Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
    Again shall you be mother to a king,
    And all the ruins of distressful times
    Repair'd with double riches of content.
    What! we have many goodly days to see.
    The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
    Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
    Advantaging their loan with interest
    Of ten times double gain of happiness.
    Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;
    Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
    Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;
    Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame
    Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes
    With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.
    And when this arm of mine hath chastised
    The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
    Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,
    And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
    To whom I will retail my conquest won,
    And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What were I best to say? Her father's
      brother
    Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?
    Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
    Under what title shall I woo for thee
    That God, the law, my honour, and her love
    Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
  KING RICHARD. Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Which she shall purchase with
    still-lasting war.
  KING RICHARD. Tell her the King, that may command,
    entreats.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King's
    King forbids.
  KING RICHARD. Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To wail the title, as her mother doth.
  KING RICHARD. Say I will love her everlastingly.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
  KING RICHARD. Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life
    last?
  KING RICHARD. As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As long as hell and Richard likes of it.
  KING RICHARD. Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But she, your subject, loathes such
    sovereignty.
  KING RICHARD. Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. An honest tale speeds best being plainly
    told.
  KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
  KING RICHARD. Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, no, my reasons are too deep and
      dead-
    Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.
  KING RICHARD. Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings
    break.
  KING RICHARD. Now, by my George, my garter, and my
    crown-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third
    usurp'd.
  KING RICHARD. I swear-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By nothing; for this is no oath:
    Thy George, profan'd, hath lost his lordly honour;
    Thy garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
    Thy crown, usurp'd, disgrac'd his kingly glory.
    If something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd,
    Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
  KING RICHARD. Then, by my self-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy self is self-misus'd.
  KING RICHARD. Now, by the world-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
  KING RICHARD. My father's death-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy life hath it dishonour'd.
  KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God-
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God's wrong is most of all.
    If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,
    The unity the King my husband made
    Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.
    If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
    Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head,
    Had grac'd the tender temples of my child;
    And both the Princes had been breathing here,
    Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,
    Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
    What canst thou swear by now?
  KING RICHARD. The time to come.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time
    o'erpast;
    For I myself have many tears to wash
    Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
    The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd,
    Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
    The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed,
    Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
    Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
    Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast.
  KING RICHARD. As I intend to prosper and repent,
    So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
    Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!
    Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
    Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
    Be opposite all planets of good luck
    To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart's love,
    Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
    I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.
    In her consists my happiness and thine;
    Without her, follows to myself and thee,
    Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
    Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.
    It cannot be avoided but by this;
    It will not be avoided but by this.
    Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-
    Be the attorney of my love to her;
    Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
    Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.
    Urge the necessity and state of times,
    And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
  KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I forget myself to be myself?
  KING RICHARD. Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong
    yourself.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Yet thou didst kill my children.
  KING RICHARD. But in your daughter's womb I bury them;
    Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed
    Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
  KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed.
  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly,
    And you shall understand from me her mind.
  KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
                               Kissing her. Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
    Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!

                 Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following

    How now! what news?
  RATCLIFF. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
    Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores
    Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
    Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back.
    'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
    And there they hull, expecting but the aid
    Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
  KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of
    Norfolk.
    Ratcliff, thyself-or Catesby; where is he?
  CATESBY. Here, my good lord.
  KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke.
  CATESBY. I will my lord, with all convenient haste.
  KING RICHARD. Ratcliff, come hither. Post to Salisbury;
    When thou com'st thither-  [To CATESBY]  Dull,
    unmindfull villain,
    Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke?
  CATESBY. First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness' pleasure,
    What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.
  KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight
    The greatest strength and power that he can make
    And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.
  CATESBY. I go.                                            Exit
  RATCLIFF. What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?
  KING RICHARD. Why, what wouldst thou do there before I
    go?
  RATCLIFF. Your Highness told me I should post before.
  KING RICHARD. My mind is chang'd.

                           Enter LORD STANLEY

  STANLEY, what news with you?
  STANLEY. None good, my liege, to please you with
    the hearing;
    Nor none so bad but well may be reported.
  KING RICHARD. Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
    What need'st thou run so many miles about,
    When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?
    Once more, what news?
  STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas.
  KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
    White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
  STANLEY. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
  KING RICHARD. Well, as you guess?
  STANLEY. Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,
    He makes for England here to claim the crown.
  KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd?
    Is the King dead, the empire unpossess'd?
    What heir of York is there alive but we?
    And who is England's King but great York's heir?
    Then tell me what makes he upon the seas.
  STANLEY. Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
  KING RICHARD. Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
    You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
    Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.
  STANLEY. No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.
  KING RICHARD. Where is thy power then, to beat him back?
    Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
    Are they not now upon the western shore,
    Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?
  STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
  KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the
    north,
    When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
  STANLEY. They have not been commanded, mighty King.
    Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,
    I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace
    Where and what time your Majesty shall please.
  KING RICHARD. Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with
    Richmond;
    But I'll not trust thee.
  STANLEY. Most mighty sovereign,
    You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
    I never was nor never will be false.
  KING RICHARD. Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind
    Your son, George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,
    Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
  STANLEY. So deal with him as I prove true to you.         Exit

                          Enter a MESSENGER

  MESSENGER. My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
    As I by friends am well advertised,
    Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,
    Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,
    With many moe confederates, are in arms.

                         Enter another MESSENGER

  SECOND MESSENGER. In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in
    arms;
    And every hour more competitors
    Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.

                         Enter another MESSENGER

  THIRD MESSENGER. My lord, the army of great Buckingham-
  KING RICHARD. Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of
    death?                                      [He strikes him]
    There, take thou that till thou bring better news.
  THIRD MESSENGER. The news I have to tell your Majesty
    Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
    Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd;
    And he himself wand'red away alone,
    No man knows whither.
  KING RICHARD. I cry thee mercy.
    There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
    Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
    Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
  THIRD MESSENGER. Such proclamation hath been made,
    my Lord.

                      Enter another MESSENGER

  FOURTH MESSENGER. Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis
    Dorset,
    'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
    But this good comfort bring I to your Highness-
    The Britaine navy is dispers'd by tempest.
    Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat
    Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
    If they were his assistants, yea or no;
    Who answer'd him they came from Buckingham
    Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,
    Hois'd sail, and made his course again for Britaine.
  KING RICHARD. March on, march on, since we are up in
    arms;
    If not to fight with foreign enemies,
    Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

                          Re-enter CATESBY

  CATESBY. My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken-
    That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond
    Is with a mighty power landed at Milford
    Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
  KING RICHARD. Away towards Salisbury! While we reason
    here
    A royal battle might be won and lost.
    Some one take order Buckingham be brought
    To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.
    Flourish.                                             Exeunt

                          LORD DERBY'S house
           Enter STANLEY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK

  STANLEY. Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
    That in the sty of the most deadly boar
    My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold;
    If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
    The fear of that holds off my present aid.
    So, get thee gone; commend me to thy lord.
    Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented
    He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
    But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
  CHRISTOPHER. At Pembroke, or at Ha'rford west in Wales.
  STANLEY. What men of name resort to him?
  CHRISTOPHER. Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
  SIR Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
  OXFORD, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
    And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew;
    And many other of great name and worth;
    And towards London do they bend their power,
    If by the way they be not fought withal.
  STANLEY. Well, hie thee to thy lord; I kiss his hand;
    My letter will resolve him of my mind.
    Farewell.                                             Exeunt


ACT5|SC1
                          ACT V. SCENE 1.

                     Salisbury. An open place
          Enter the SHERIFF and guard, with BUCKINGHAM,
                        led to execution

  BUCKINGHAM. Will not King Richard let me speak with
    him?
  SHERIFF. No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
  BUCKINGHAM. Hastings, and Edward's children, Grey, and
    Rivers,
    Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
    Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
    By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
    If that your moody discontented souls
    Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
    Even for revenge mock my destruction!
    This is All-Souls' day, fellow, is it not?
  SHERIFF. It is, my lord.
  BUCKINGHAM. Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's
    doomsday.
    This is the day which in King Edward's time
    I wish'd might fall on me when I was found
    False to his children and his wife's allies;
    This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
    By the false faith of him whom most I trusted;
    This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
    Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs;
    That high All-Seer which I dallied with
    Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
    And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
    Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men
    To turn their own points in their masters' bosoms.
    Thus Margaret's curse falls heavy on my neck.
    'When he' quoth she 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
    Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
    Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame;
    Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.          Exeunt

            Enter RICHMOND, OXFORD, SIR JAMES BLUNT,
              SIR WALTER HERBERT, and others, with
                         drum and colours

  RICHMOND. Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
    Bruis'd underneath the yoke of tyranny,
    Thus far into the bowels of the land
    Have we march'd on without impediment;
    And here receive we from our father Stanley
    Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
    The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
    That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
    Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
    In your embowell'd bosoms-this foul swine
    Is now even in the centre of this isle,
    Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
    From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
    In God's name cheerly on, courageous friends,
    To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
    By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
  OXFORD. Every man's conscience is a thousand men,
    To fight against this guilty homicide.
  HERBERT. I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.
  BLUNT. He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,
    Which in his dearest need will fly from him.
  RICHMOND. All for our vantage. Then in God's name march.
    True hope is swift and flies with swallow's wings;
    Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.      Exeunt

                              SCENE 3.

                           Bosworth Field
              Enter KING RICHARD in arms, with NORFOLK,
              RATCLIFF, the EARL of SURREYS and others

  KING RICHARD. Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth
    field.
    My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
  SURREY. My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
  KING RICHARD. My Lord of Norfolk!
  NORFOLK. Here, most gracious liege.
  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we
    not?
  NORFOLK. We must both give and take, my loving lord.
  KING RICHARD. Up With my tent! Here will I lie to-night;
                      [Soldiers begin to set up the KING'S tent]
    But where to-morrow? Well, all's one for that.
    Who hath descried the number of the traitors?
  NORFOLK. Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
  KING RICHARD. Why, our battalia trebles that account;
    Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength,
    Which they upon the adverse faction want.
    Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
    Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
    Call for some men of sound direction.
    Let's lack no discipline, make no delay;
    For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.                  Exeunt

             Enter, on the other side of the field,
          RICHMOND, SIR WILLIAM BRANDON, OXFORD, DORSET,
              and others. Some pitch RICHMOND'S tent

  RICHMOND. The weary sun hath made a golden set,
    And by the bright tract of his fiery car
    Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.
    Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
    Give me some ink and paper in my tent.
    I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
    Limit each leader to his several charge,
    And part in just proportion our small power.
    My Lord of Oxford-you, Sir William Brandon-
    And you, Sir Walter Herbert-stay with me.
    The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment;
    Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him,
    And by the second hour in the morning
    Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.
    Yet one thing more, good Captain, do for me-
    Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, do you know?
  BLUNT. Unless I have mista'en his colours much-
    Which well I am assur'd I have not done-
    His regiment lies half a mile at least
    South from the mighty power of the King.
  RICHMOND. If without peril it be possible,
    Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him
    And give him from me this most needful note.
  BLUNT. Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;
    And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
  RICHMOND. Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come,
    gentlemen,
    Let us consult upon to-morrow's business.
    In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold.
                                   [They withdraw into the tent]

            Enter, to his-tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK,
                       RATCLIFF, and CATESBY

  KING RICHARD. What is't o'clock?
  CATESBY. It's supper-time, my lord;
    It's nine o'clock.
  KING RICHARD. I will not sup to-night.
    Give me some ink and paper.
    What, is my beaver easier than it was?
    And all my armour laid into my tent?
  CATESBY. It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
  KING RICHARD. Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
    Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
  NORFOLK. I go, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.
  NORFOLK. I warrant you, my lord.                          Exit
  KING RICHARD. Catesby!
  CATESBY. My lord?
  KING RICHARD. Send out a pursuivant-at-arms
    To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
    Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
    Into the blind cave of eternal night.           Exit CATESBY
    Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
    Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
    Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
    Ratcliff!
  RATCLIFF. My lord?
  KING RICHARD. Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord
    Northumberland?
  RATCLIFF. Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
    Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
    Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
  KING RICHARD. So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.
    I have not that alacrity of spirit
    Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.
    Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
  RATCLIFF. It is, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Bid my guard watch; leave me.
  RATCLIFF, about the mid of night come to my tent
    And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.
                                   Exit RATCLIFF. RICHARD sleeps

               Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent;
                        LORDS attending

  DERBY. Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!
  RICHMOND. All comfort that the dark night can afford
    Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
    Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
  DERBY. I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
    Who prays continually for Richmond's good.
    So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
    And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
    In brief, for so the season bids us be,
    Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
    And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
    Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
    I, as I may-that which I would I cannot-
    With best advantage will deceive the time
    And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms;
    But on thy side I may not be too forward,
    Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
    Be executed in his father's sight.
    Farewell; the leisure and the fearful time
    Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
    And ample interchange of sweet discourse
    Which so-long-sund'red friends should dwell upon.
    God give us leisure for these rites of love!
    Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!
  RICHMOND. Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.
    I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,
    Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow
    When I should mount with wings of victory.
    Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
                                         Exeunt all but RICHMOND
    O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
    Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
    Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath,
    That they may crush down with a heavy fall
    The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
    Make us Thy ministers of chastisement,
    That we may praise Thee in the victory!
    To Thee I do commend my watchful soul
    Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.
    Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!            [Sleeps]

            Enter the GHOST Of YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD,
                    son to HENRY THE SIXTH

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy on thy soul
    to-morrow!
    Think how thou stabb'dst me in my prime of youth
    At Tewksbury; despair, therefore, and die!
    [To RICHMOND]  Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged
    souls
    Of butcher'd princes fight in thy behalf.
    King Henry's issue, Richmond, comforts thee.

              Enter the GHOST of HENRY THE SIXTH

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  When I was mortal, my anointed
    body
    By thee was punched full of deadly holes.
    Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die.
    Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
    [To RICHMOND]  Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!
    Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be King,
    Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish!

                   Enter the GHOST of CLARENCE

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy soul
    to-morrow! I that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,
    Poor Clarence, by thy guile betray'd to death!
    To-morrow in the battle think on me,
    And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!
    [To RICHMOND]  Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,
    The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee.
    Good angels guard thy battle! Live and flourish!

           Enter the GHOSTS of RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN

  GHOST OF RIVERS.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy
    soul to-morrow,
    Rivers that died at Pomfret! Despair and die!
  GHOST OF GREY.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Grey, and let
    thy soul despair!
  GHOST OF VAUGHAN.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Vaughan,
    and with guilty fear
    Let fall thy lance. Despair and die!
  ALL.  [To RICHMOND]  Awake, and think our wrongs in
    Richard's bosom
    Will conquer him. Awake and win the day.

                Enter the GHOST of HASTINGS

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
    And in a bloody battle end thy days!
    Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die.
    [To RICHMOND]   Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
    Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!

         Enter the GHOSTS of the two young PRINCES

  GHOSTS.  [To RICHARD]  Dream on thy cousins smothered in
    the Tower.
    Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
    And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
    Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die.
    [To RICHMOND]  Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and
    wake in joy;
    Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!
    Live, and beget a happy race of kings!
    Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

          Enter the GHOST of LADY ANNE, his wife

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Richard, thy wife, that wretched
    Anne thy wife
    That never slept a quiet hour with thee
    Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
    To-morrow in the battle think on me,
    And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die.
    [To RICHMOND]  Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;
    Dream of success and happy victory.
    Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.

                   Enter the GHOST of BUCKINGHAM

  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  The first was I that help'd thee
    to the crown;
    The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
    O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
    And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
    Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death;
    Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
    [To RICHMOND]  I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid;
    But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd:
    God and good angels fight on Richmond's side;
    And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
            [The GHOSTS vanish. RICHARD starts out of his dream]
  KING RICHARD. Give me another horse. Bind up my wounds.
    Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.
    O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
    The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
    Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
    What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by.
    Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
    Is there a murderer here? No-yes, I am.
    Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why-
    Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself!
    Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good
    That I myself have done unto myself?
    O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself
    For hateful deeds committed by myself!
    I am a villain; yet I lie, I am not.
    Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.
    My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
    And every tongue brings in a several tale,
    And every tale condemns me for a villain.
    Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;
    Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;
    All several sins, all us'd in each degree,
    Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!'
    I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
    And if I die no soul will pity me:
    And wherefore should they, since that I myself
    Find in myself no pity to myself?
    Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
    Came to my tent, and every one did threat
    To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.

                            Enter RATCLIFF

  RATCLIFF. My lord!
  KING RICHARD. Zounds, who is there?
  RATCLIFF. Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
    Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
    Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.
  KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
    What think'st thou-will our friends prove all true?
  RATCLIFF. No doubt, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear.
  RATCLIFF. Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
  KING RICHARD By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
    Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard
    Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
    Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
    'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;
    Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
    To see if any mean to shrink from me.                 Exeunt

          Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sitting in his tent

  LORDS. Good morrow, Richmond!
  RICHMOND. Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
    That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
  LORDS. How have you slept, my lord?
  RICHMOND. The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
    That ever ent'red in a drowsy head
    Have I since your departure had, my lords.
    Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd
    Came to my tent and cried on victory.
    I promise you my soul is very jocund
    In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
    How far into the morning is it, lords?
  LORDS. Upon the stroke of four.
  RICHMOND. Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.

                 His ORATION to his SOLDIERS

    More than I have said, loving countrymen,
    The leisure and enforcement of the time
    Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:
    God and our good cause fight upon our side;
    The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
    Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
    Richard except, those whom we fight against
    Had rather have us win than him they follow.
    For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
    A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
    One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
    One that made means to come by what he hath,
    And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
    A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
    Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
    One that hath ever been God's enemy.
    Then if you fight against God's enemy,
    God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
    If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
    You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
    If you do fight against your country's foes,
    Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire;
    If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
    Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
    If you do free your children from the sword,
    Your children's children quits it in your age.
    Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
    Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
    For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
    Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
    But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
    The least of you shall share his part thereof.
    Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
    God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!           Exeunt

           Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, attendants,
                         and forces

  KING RICHARD. What said Northumberland as touching
    Richmond?
  RATCLIFF. That he was never trained up in arms.
  KING RICHARD. He said the truth; and what said Surrey
    then?
  RATCLIFF. He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.'
  KING He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
                                                 [Clock strikes]
    Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
    Who saw the sun to-day?
  RATCLIFF. Not I, my lord.
  KING RICHARD. Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
    He should have brav'd the east an hour ago.
    A black day will it be to somebody.
    Ratcliff!
  RATCLIFF. My lord?
  KING RICHARD. The sun will not be seen to-day;
    The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
    I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
    Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
    More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven
    That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

                       Enter NORFOLK

  NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
  KING RICHARD. Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse;
    Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.
    I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
    And thus my battle shall be ordered:
    My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
    Consisting equally of horse and foot;
    Our archers shall be placed in the midst.
    John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
    Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
    They thus directed, we will follow
    In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
    Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
    This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou,
    Norfolk?
  NORFOLK. A good direction, warlike sovereign.
    This found I on my tent this morning.
                                        [He sheweth him a paper]
  KING RICHARD.                                          [Reads]
    'Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold,
    For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
    A thing devised by the enemy.
    Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.
    Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;
    Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
    Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe.
    Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
    March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell;
    If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.

                      His ORATION to his ARMY

    What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
    Remember whom you are to cope withal-
    A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
    A scum of Britaines, and base lackey peasants,
    Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
    To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.
    You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
    You having lands, and bless'd with beauteous wives,
    They would restrain the one, distain the other.
    And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
    Long kept in Britaine at our mother's cost?
    A milk-sop, one that never in his life
    Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
    Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
    Lash hence these over-weening rags of France,
    These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
    Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
    For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves.
    If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
    And not these bastard Britaines, whom our fathers
    Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
    And, in record, left them the heirs of shame.
    Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives,
    Ravish our daughters?  [Drum afar off]  Hark! I hear their
    drum.
    Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen!
    Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
    Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
    Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!

                        Enter a MESSENGER

    What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?
  MESSENGER. My lord, he doth deny to come.
  KING RICHARD. Off with his son George's head!
  NORFOLK. My lord, the enemy is pass'd the marsh.
    After the battle let George Stanley die.
  KING RICHARD. A thousand hearts are great within my
    bosom.
    Advance our standards, set upon our foes;
    Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
    Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
    Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.                 Exeunt


ACT5|SC4
                              SCENE 4.

                     Another part of the field
            Alarum; excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces;
                         to him CATESBY

  CATESBY. Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
    The King enacts more wonders than a man,
    Daring an opposite to every danger.
    His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
    Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
    Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost.

                     Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD

  KING RICHARD. A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
  CATESBY. Withdraw, my lord! I'll help you to a horse.
  KING RICHARD. Slave, I have set my life upon a cast
    And I Will stand the hazard of the die.
    I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
    Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
    A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!             Exeunt


ACT5|SC5
                             SCENE 5.

                    Another part of the field
         Alarum. Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND; they fight;
          RICHARD is slain. Retreat and flourish. Enter
        RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the crown, with other LORDS

  RICHMOND. God and your arms be prais'd, victorious friends;
    The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
  DERBY. Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee!
    Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
    From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
    Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal.
    Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
  RICHMOND. Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
    But, teLL me is young George Stanley living.
  DERBY. He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
    Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
  RICHMOND. What men of name are slain on either side?
  DERBY. John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
    Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
  RICHMOND. Inter their bodies as becomes their births.
    Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
    That in submission will return to us.
    And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
    We will unite the white rose and the red.
    Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
    That long have frown'd upon their emnity!
    What traitor hears me, and says not Amen?
    England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
    The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
    The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
    The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire;
    All this divided York and Lancaster,
    Divided in their dire division,
    O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,
    The true succeeders of each royal house,
    By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
    And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so,
    Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace,
    With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!
    Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
    That would reduce these bloody days again
    And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
    Let them not live to taste this land's increase
    That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!
    Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again-
    That she may long live here, God say Amen!            Exeunt

VENUS AND ADONIS 
  
Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo 
 Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua
TO THE 
RIGHT HONOURABLE 
HENRY WRIOTHESLEY, 
EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON, AND BARON 
OF TITCHFIELD

Right Honourable, 
  I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to 
your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for choosing so 
strong a prop to support so weak a burden: only, if your honour seem 
but pleased, I account my self highly praised, and vow to take 
advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some graver 
labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I 
shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather, and never after ear so 
barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it 
to your honourable survey, and your honour to your heart's content; 
which I wish may always answer your own wish, and the world's 
hopeful expectations. 
                                    Your honour's in all duty, 
                                           William Shakespeare 
  
 

  
VEN as the sun with purple-coloured face 
  Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn, 
  Rose-cheeked Adonis hied him to the chase; 
  Hunting he loved, but love he laughed to scorn. 
    Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him, 
    And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.

  'Thrice fairer than myself,' thus she began, 
  'The field's chief flower, sweet above compare, 
  Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man, 
  More white and red than doves or roses are; 
    Nature that made thee with herself at strife 
    Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.

  'Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed, 
  And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow; 
  If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed 
  A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know. 
    Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses, 
    And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses;

  'And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed saiety, 
  But rather famish them amid their plenty, 
  Making them red and pale with fresh variety; 
  Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty. 
    A summer's day will seem an hour but short, 
    Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'

  With this she seizeth on his sweating palm, 
  The precedent of pith and livelihood, 
  And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm, 
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good. 
    Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force 
    Courageously to pluck him from his horse.

  Over one arm the lusty courser's rein, 
  Under her other was the tender boy, 
  Who blushed and pouted in a dull disdain, 
  With leaden appetite, unapt to toy; 
    She red and hot as coals of glowing fire, 
    He red for shame, but frosty in desire.

  The studded bridle on a ragged bough 
  Nimbly she fastens- O, how quick is love! 
  The steed is stalled up, and even now 
  To tie the rider she begins to prove. 
    Backward she pushed him, as she would be thrust, 
    And governed him in strength, though not in lust.

  So soon was she along as he was down, 
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips; 
  Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown, 
  And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips, 
    And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken, 
    'If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'

  He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears 
  Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks; 
  Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs 
  To fan and blow them dry again she seeks. 
    He saith she is immodest, blames her miss; 
    What follows more she murders with a kiss.

  Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast, 
  Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone, 
  Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste, 
  Till either gorge be stuffed or prey be gone; 
    Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin, 
    And where she ends she doth anew begin.

  Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should, 
  Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire. 
  Affection is a coal that must be cooled; 
  Else, suffered, it will set the heart on fire. 
    The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none, 
    Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.

  'How like a jade he stood tied to the tree, 
  Servilely mastered with a leathern rein! 
  But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee, 
  He held such petty bondage in disdain, 
    Throwing the base thong from his bending crest, 
    Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.

  'Who sees his true-love in her naked bed, 
  Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white, 
  But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed, 
  His other agents aim at like delight? 
    Who is so faint that dares not be so bold 
    To touch the fire, the weather being cold?

  'Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;' 
  And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee, 
  To take advantage on presented joy; 
  Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee. 
    O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain, 
    And once made perfect, never lost again.'

  'I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it, 
  Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it. 
  'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it. 
  My love to love is love but to disgrace it; 
    For I have heard it is a life in death, 
    That laughs, and weeps, and all but with a breath.

  'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinished? 
  Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth? 
  If springing things be any jot diminished, 
  They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth. 
    The colt that's backed and burdened being young 
    Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.

  'You hurt my hand with wringing; let us part, 
  And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat; 
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart; 
  To love's alarms it will not ope the gate. 
    Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt'ry; 
    For where a heart is hard they make no batt'ry.'

  'What, canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue? 
  O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing! 
  Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong; 
  I had my load before, now pressed with bearing: 
    Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh sounding, 
    Ears' deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.

  'Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love 
  That inward beauty and invisible; 
  Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move 
  Each part in me that were but sensible. 
    Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see, 
    Yet should I be in love by touching thee.

  'Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me, 
  And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch, 
  And nothing but the very smell were left me, 
  Yet would my love to thee be still as much; 
    For from the stillitory of thy face excelling 
    Comes breath perfumed, that breedeth love by smelling.

  'But O, what banquet wert thou to the taste, 
  Being nurse and feeder of the other four! 
  Would they not wish the feast might ever last, 
  And bid Suspicion double-lock the door, 
    Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest, 
    Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?'

  Once more the ruby-coloured portal opened, 
  Which to his speech did honey passage yield; 
  Like a red morn, that ever yet betokened 
  Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field, 
    Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds, 
    Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.

  This ill presage advisedly she marketh. 
  Even as the wind is hushed before it raineth, 
  Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh, 
  Or as the berry breaks before it staineth, 
    Or like the deadly bullet of a gun, 
    His meaning struck her ere his words begun.

  And at his look she flatly falleth down, 
  For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth; 
  A smile recures the wounding of a frown. 
  But blessed bankrupt that by loss so thriveth! 
    The silly boy, believing she is dead, 
    Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;

  And all amazed brake off his late intent, 
  For sharply he did think to reprehend her, 
  Which cunning love did wittily prevent. 
  Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her! 
    For on the grass she lies as she were slain, 
    Till his breath breatheth life in her again.

  He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks, 
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard, 
  He chafes her lips, a thousand ways he seeks 
  To mend the hurt that his unkindness marred; 
    He kisses her; and she, by her good will, 
    Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.

  The night of sorrow now is turned to day: 
  Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth, 
  Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array 
  He cheers the morn, and all the earth relieveth; 
    And as the bright sun glorifies the sky, 
    So is her face illumined with her eye;

  Whose beams upon his hairless face are fixed, 
  As if from thence they borrowed all their shine. 
  Were never four such lamps together mixed, 
  Had not his clouded with his brow's repine; 
    But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light, 
    Shone like the moon in water seen by night.

  Forced to content, but never to obey, 
  Panting he lies and breatheth in her face; 
  She feedeth on the steam as on a prey, 
  And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace, 
    Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers, 
    So they were dewed with such distilling showers.

  Look how a bird lies tangled in a net, 
  So fast'ned in her arms Adonis lies; 
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret, 
  Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes. 
    Rain added to a river that is rank 
    Perforce will force it overflow the bank.

  Still she entreats, and prettily entreats, 
  For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale; 
  Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets, 
  'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale; 
    Being red, she loves him best, and being white, 
    Her best is bettered with a more delight.

  Look how he can, she cannot choose but love; 
  And by her fair immortal hand she swears 
  From his soft bosom never to remove 
  Till he take truce with her contending tears, 
    Which long have rained, making her cheeks all wet; 
    And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.

  Upon this promise did he raise his chin, 
  Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave, 
  Who, being looked on, ducks as quickly in; 
  So offers he to give what she did crave; 
    But when her lips were ready for his pay, 
    He winks, and turns his lips another way.

  Never did passenger in summer's heat 
  More thirst for drink than she for this good turn. 
  Her help she sees, but help she cannot get; 
  She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn. 
    'O, pity,' 'gan she cry. 'flint-hearted boy! 
    'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?

  'I have been wooed, as I entreat thee now, 
  Even by the stern and direful god of war, 
  Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow, 
  Who conquers where he comes in every jar; 
    Yet hath he been my captive and my slave, 
    And begged for that which thou unasked shalt have.

  'Over my altars hath he hung his lance, 
  His batt'red shield, his uncontrolled crest, 
  And for my sake hath learned to sport and dance, 
  To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest, 
    Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red, 
    Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.

  'Thus he that overruled I overswayed, 
  Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain; 
  Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obeyed, 
  Yet was he servile to my coy disdain. 
    O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might, 
    For mast'ring her that foiled the god of fight!

  'Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine- 
  Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red- 
  The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine. 
  What see'st thou in the ground? hold up thy head; 
    Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies; 
    Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?

  'Art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again, 
  And I will wink; so shall the day seem night. 
  Love keeps his revels where there are but twain; 
  Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight. 
    These blue-veined violets whereon we lean 
    Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.

  'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip 
  Shews thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted; 
  Make use of time, let not advantage slip; 
  Beauty within itself should not be wasted. 
    Fair flowers that are not gath'red in their prime 
    Rot and consume themselves in little time.

  'Were I hard-favoured, foul, or wrinkled-old, 
  Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice, 
  O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold, 
  Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice, 
    Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee; 
    But having no defects, why dost abhor me?

  'Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow; 
  Mine eyes are grey and bright and quick in turning; 
  My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow, 
  My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning; 
    My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt, 
    Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.

  'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear, 
  Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green, 
  Or, like a nymph, with long dishevelled hair, 
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen. 
    Love is a spirit all compact of fire, 
    Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.

  'Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie; 
  These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me; 
  Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky 
  From morn till night, even where I list to sport me. 
    Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be 
    That thou should think it heavy unto thee?

  'Is thine own heart to thine own face affected? 
  Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left? 
  Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected, 
  Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft. 
    Narcissus so himself forsook, 
    And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.

  'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear, 
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use, 
  Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear; 
  Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse. 
    Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty; 
    Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.

  'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed, 
  Unless the earth with thy increase be fed? 
  By law of nature thou art bound to breed, 
  That thine may live when thou thyself art dead; 
    And so in spite of death thou dost survive, 
    In that thy likeness still is left alive.'

  By this, the love-sick queen began to sweat, 
  For where they lay the shadow had forsook them, 
  And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat, 
  With burning eye did hotly overlook them, 
    Wishing Adonis had his team to guide, 
    So he were like him, and by Venus' side.

  And now Adonis, with a lazy sprite, 
  And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye, 
  His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight, 
  Like misty vapours when they blot the sky, 
    Souring his cheeks, cries 'Fie, no more of love! 
    The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.'

  'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind! 
  What bare excuses mak'st thou to be gone! 
  I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind 
  Shall cool the heat of this descending sun; 
    I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs; 
    If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.

  'The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm, 
  And lo, I lie between that sun and thee; 
  The heat I have from thence doth little harm; 
  Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me; 
    And were I not immortal, life were done 
    Between this heavenly and earthly sun.

  'Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel? 
  Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth. 
  Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel 
  What 'tis to love, how want of love tormenteth? 
    O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind, 
    She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.

  'What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this? 
  Or what great danger dwells upon my suit? 
  What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss? 
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute. 
    Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again, 
    And one for int'rest, if thou wilt have twain.

  'Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone, 
  Well painted idol, image dull ind dead, 
  Statue contenting but the eye alone, 
  Thing like a man, but of no woman bred! 
    Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion, 
    For men will kiss even by their own direction.'

  This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue, 
  And swelling passion doth provoke a pause; 
  Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong; 
  Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause; 
    And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak, 
    And now her sobs do her intendments break.

  Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand, 
  Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground; 
  Sometime her arms infold him like a band; 
  She would, he will not in her arms be bound; 
    And when from thence he struggles to be gone, 
    She locks her lily fingers one in one.

  'Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemmed thee here 
  Within the circuit of this ivory pale, 
  I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer; 
  Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale; 
    Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry, 
    Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.

  'Within this limit is relief enough, 
  Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain, 
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough, 
  To shelter thee from tempest and from rain: 
    Then be my deer, since I am such a park; 
    No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'

  At this Adonis smiles as in disdain, 
  That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple. 
  Love made those hollows, if himself were slain, 
  He might be buried in a tomb so simple; 
    Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie, 
    Why, there Love lived, and there he could not die.

  These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits, 
  Opened their mouths to swallow Venus' liking. 
  Being mad before, how doth she now for wits? 
  Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking? 
    Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn, 
    To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!

  Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say? 
  Her words are done, her woes the more increasing; 
  The time is spent, her object will away, 
  And from her twining arms doth urge releasing. 
    'Pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!' 
    Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.

  But lo, from forth a copse that neighbours by, 
  A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud, 
  Adonis' trampling courser doth espy, 
  And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud. 
    The strong-necked steed, being tied unto a tree, 
    Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he.

  Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds, 
  And now his woven girths he breaks asunder; 
  The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds, 
  Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder; 
    The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth, 
    Controlling what he was controlled with.

  His ears up-pricked; his braided hanging mane 
  Upon his compassed crest now stand on end; 
  His nostrils drink the air, and forth again, 
  As from a furnace, vapours doth he send; 
    His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire, 
    Shows his hot courage and his high desire.

  Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps, 
  With gentle majesty and modest pride; 
  Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps, 
  As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried, 
    And this I do to captivate the eye 
    Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'

  What recketh he his rider's angry stir, 
  His flattering 'Holla' or his 'Stand, I say?' 
  What cares he now for curb or pricking spur? 
  For rich caparisons or trappings gay? 
    He sees his love, and nothing else he sees, 
    For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.

  Look when a painter would surpass the life 
  In limning out a well-proportioned steed, 
  His art with nature's workmanship at strife, 
  As if the dead the living should exceed; 
    So did this horse excel a common one 
    In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.

  Round-hoofed, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long, 
  Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide, 
  High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong, 
  Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide; 
    Look what a horse should have he did not lack, 
    Save a proud rider on so proud a back.

  Sometime he scuds far off, and there he stares; 
  Anon he starts at stirring of a feather; 
  To bid the wind a base he now prepares, 
  And whe'er he run or fly they know not whether; 
    For through his mane and tail the high wind sings, 
    Fanning the hairs, who wave like feath'red wings.

  He looks upon his love and neighs unto her; 
  She answers him as if she knew his mind; 
  Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her, 
  She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind, 
    Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels, 
    Beating his kind embracements with her heels.

  Then, like a melancholy malcontent, 
  He vails his tail, that, like a falling plume, 
  Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent; 
  He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume. 
    His love, perceiving how he was enraged, 
    Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.

  His testy master goeth about to take him, 
  When, lo, the unbacked breeder, full of fear, 
  Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him, 
  With her the horse, and left Adonis there. 
    As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them, 
    Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.

  All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits, 
  Banning his boist'rous and unruly beast; 
  And now the happy season once more fits 
  That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest; 
    For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong 
    When it is barred the aidance of the tongue.

  An oven that is stopped, or river stayed, 
  Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage; 
  So of concealed sorrow may be said, 
  Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage; 
    But when the heart's attorney once is mute, 
    The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.

  He sees her coming, and begins to glow, 
  Even as a dying coal revives with wind, 
  And with his bonnet hides his angry brow, 
  Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind, 
    Taking no notice that she is so nigh, 
    For all askance he holds her in his eye.

  O, what a sight it was, wistly to view 
  How she came stealing to the wayward boy! 
  To note the fighting conflict of her hue, 
  How white and red each other did destroy! 
    But now her cheek was pale, and by and by 
    It flashed forth fire, as lightning from the sky.

  Now was she just before him as he sat, 
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels; 
  With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat, 
  Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels; 
    His tend'rer cheek receives her soft hand's print 
    As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.

  O, what a war of looks was then between them, 
  Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing! 
  His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them; 
  Her eyes wooed still, his eyes disdained the wooing; 
    And all this dumb play had his acts made plain 
    With tears which chorus-like her eyes did rain.

  Full gently now she takes him by the hand, 
  A lily prisoned in a gaol of snow, 
  Or ivory in an alabaster band; 
  So white a friend engirts so white a foe: 
    This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling, 
    Showed like two silver doves that sit a-billing.

  Once more the engine of her thoughts began: 
  'O fairest mover on this mortal round, 
  Would thou wert as I am, and I a man, 
  My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound; 
    For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee, 
    Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee.'

  'Give me my hand,' saith he; 'why dost thou feel it?' 
  'Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it; 
  O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it, 
  And being steeled, soft sighs can never grave it; 
    Then love's deep groans I never shall regard, 
    Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'

  'For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go; 
  My day's delight is past, my horse is gone, 
  And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so. 
  I pray you hence, and leave me here alone; 
    For all my mind, my thought, my busy care, 
    Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'

  'O, where am I?' quoth she; 'in earth or heaven, 
  Or in the ocean drenched, or in the fire? 
  What hour is this? or morn or weary even? 
  Do I delight to die, or life desire? 
    But now I lived, and life was death's annoy; 
    But now I died, and death was lively joy.

  'O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again. 
  Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine, 
  Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain 
  That they have murd'red this poor heart of mine; 
    And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen, 
    But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.

  'Long may they kiss each other, for this cure! 
  O, never let their crimson liveries wear! 
  And as they last, their verdure still endure 
  To drive infection from the dangerous year! 
    That the star-gazers, having writ on death, 
    May say, the plague is banished by thy breath.

  'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted, 
  What bargains may I make, still to be sealing? 
  To sell myself I can be well contented, 
  So thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing; 
    Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips 
    Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips.

  'A thousand kisses buys my heart from me; 
  And pay them at thy leisure, one by one. 
  What is ten hundred touches unto thee? 
  Are they not quickly told and quickly gone? 
    Say for non-payment that the debt should double, 
    Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?'

  'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me, 
  Measure my strangeness with my unripe years; 
  Before I know myself, seek not to know me; 
  No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears. 
    The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast, 
    Or being early plucked is sour to taste.

  'Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait, 
  His day's hot task hath ended in the west; 
  The owl, night's herald, shrieks 'tis very late; 
  The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest; 
    And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light 
    Do summon us to part, and bid good night.

  'Now let me say "Good night", and so say you; 
  If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.' 
  'Good night', quoth she; and, ere he says 'Adieu', 
  The honey fee of parting tend'red is: 
    Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace; 
    Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.

  Till breathless he disjoined, and backward drew 
  The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth, 
  Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew, 
  Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth. 
    He with her plenty pressed, she faint with dearth, 
    Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.

  Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey, 
  And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth; 
  Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey, 
  Paying what ransom the insulter willeth; 
    Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high 
    That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry.

  And having felt the sweetness of the spoil, 
  With blindfold fury she begins to forage; 
  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil, 
  And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage. 
    Planting oblivion, beating reason back, 
    Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.

  Hot, faint and weary, with her, hard embracing, 
  Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling, 
  Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing, 
  Or like the froward infant stilled with dandling, 
    He now obeys and now no more resisteth, 
    While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.

  What wax so frozen but dissolves with temp'ring, 
  And yields at last to every light impression? 
  Things out of hope are compass'd oft with vent'ring, 
  Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission: 
    Affection faints not like a pale-face coward, 
    But then woos best when most his choice is froward.

  When he did frown, O, had she then gave over, 
  Such nectar from his lips she had not sucked. 
  Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover; 
  What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis plucked. 
    Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast, 
    Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last.

  For pity now she can no more detain him; 
  The poor fool prays her that he may depart. 
  She is resolved no longer to restrain him; 
  Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart, 
    The which by Cupid's bow she doth protest 
    He carries thence incaged in his breast.

  'Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow, 
  For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch. 
  Tell me, love's master, shall we meet to-morrow? 
  Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?' 
    He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends 
    To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.

  'The boar!' quoth she: whereat a sudden pale, 
  Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose, 
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale, 
  And on his neck her yoking arms she throws. 
    She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck, 
    He on her belly falls, she on her back.

  Now is she in the very lists of love, 
  Her champion mounted for the hot encounter. 
  All is imaginary she doth prove; 
  He will not manage her, although he mount her; 
    That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy, 
    To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.

  Even so poor birds, deceived with painted grapes, 
  Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw; 
  Even so she languisheth in her mishaps 
  As those poor birds that helpless berries saw. 
    The warm effects which she in him finds missing 
    She seeks to kindly with continual kissing.

  But all in vain, good queen, it will not be. 
  She hath assayed as much as may be proved; 
  Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee; 
  She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved. 
    'Fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go; 
    You have no reason to withhold me so.'

  'Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this, 
  But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar. 
  O, be advised: thou know'st not what it is 
  With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore, 
    Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still, 
    Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.

  'On his bow-back he hath a battle set 
  Of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes; 
  His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret; 
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes; 
    Being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way, 
    And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay.

  'His brawny sides, with hairy bristles armed, 
  Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter; 
  His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed; 
  Being ireful, on the lion he will venter: 
    The thorny brambles and embracing bushes, 
    As fearful of him, part; through whom he rushes.

  'Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine, 
  To which Love's eyes pays tributary gazes; 
  Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne, 
  Whose full perfection all the world amazes; 
    But having thee at vantage- wondrous dread!- 
    Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.

  'O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still; 
  Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends. 
  Come not within his danger by thy will; 
  They that thrive well take counsel of their friends. 
    When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble, 
    I feared thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.

  'Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white? 
  Saws't thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye? 
  Grew I not faint? and fell I not downright? 
  Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie, 
    My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest, 
    But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.

  'For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy 
  Doth call himself Affection's sentinel; 
  Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny, 
  And in a peaceful hour doth cry "Kill, kill!" 
    Distemp'ring gentle Love in his desire, 
    As air and water do abate the fire.

  'This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy, 
  This canker that eats up Love's tender spring, 
  This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy, 
  That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring, 
    Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear 
    That if I love thee I thy death should fear;

  'And more than so, presenteth to mine eye 
  The picture of an angry chafing boar 
  Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie 
  An image like thyself, all stained with gore; 
    Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed 
    Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.

  'What should I do, seeing thee so indeed, 
  That tremble at th'imagination? 
  The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed, 
  And fear doth teach it divination: 
    I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow, 
    If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.

  'But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me; 
  Uncouple at the timorous flying hare, 
  Or at the fox which lives by subtlety, 
  Or at the roe which no encounter dare. 
    Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs, 
    And on thy well-breathed horse keep with thy hounds.

  'And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare, 
  Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles, 
  How he outruns the wind, and with what care 
  He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles. 
    The many musits through the which he goes 
    Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.

  'Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep, 
  To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell, 
  And sometime where earth-delving conies keep, 
  To stop the loud pursuers in their yell; 
    And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer. 
    Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear.

  'For there his smell with others being mingled, 
  The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt, 
  Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled 
  With much ado the cold fault cleanly out. 
    Then do they spend their mouths; Echo replies, 
    As if another chase were in the skies.

  'By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill, 
  Stands on his hinder legs with list'ning ear, 
  To hearken if his foes pursue him still; 
  Anon their loud alarums he doth hear; 
    And now his grief may be compared well 
    To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.

  'Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch 
  Turn, and return, indenting with the way; 
  Each envious brier his weary legs do scratch, 
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay; 
    For misery is trodden on by many, 
    And being low never relieved by any.

  'Lie quietly and hear a little more; 
  Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise. 
  To make thee hate the hunting of the boar, 
  Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize, 
    Applying this to that, and so to so; 
    For love can comment upon every woe.

  'Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he; 
  'Leave me, and then the story aptly ends. 
  The night is spent.' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she. 
  'I am', quoth he, 'expected of my friends; 
    And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.' 
    'In night', quoth she, 'desire sees best of all.

  'But if thou fall, O, then imagine this, 
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips, 
  And all is but to rob thee of a kiss. 
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips 
    Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn, 
    Lest she should steal a kiss, and die forsworn.

  'Now of this dark night I perceive the reason: 
  Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine, 
  Till forging Nature be condemned of treason, 
  For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine, 
    Wherein she framed thee, in high heaven's despite, 
    To shame the sun by day and her by night.

  'And therefore hath she bribed the Destinies 
  To cross the curious workmanship of Nature, 
  To mingle beauty with infirmities 
  And pure perfection with impure defeature, 
    Making it subject to the tyranny 
    Of mad mischances and much misery;

  'As burning fevers, agues pale and faint, 
  Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood, 
  The marrow-eating sickness whose attaint 
  Disorder breeds by heating of the blood, 
    Surfeits, imposthumes, grief and damned despair, 
    Swear Nature's death for framing thee so fair.

  'And not the least of all these maladies 
  But in one minute's fight brings beauty under. 
  Both favour, savour, hue and qualities, 
  Whereat th'impartial gazer late did wonder, 
    Are on the sudden wasted, thawed and done, 
    As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.

  'Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity, 
  Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns, 
  That on the earth would breed a scarcity 
  And barren dearth of daughters and of sons, 
    Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night 
    Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.

  'What is thy body but a swallowing grave, 
  Seeming to bury that posterity 
  Which by the rights of time thou needs must have, 
  If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity? 
    If so, the world will hold thee in disdain, 
    Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.

  'So in thyself thyself art made away; 
  A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife, 
  Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay, 
  Or butcher sire that reaves his son of life. 
    Foul cank'ring rust the hidden treasure frets, 
    But gold that's put to use more gold begets.'

  'Nay, then,' quoth Adon, you will fall again 
  Into your idle over-handied theme; 
  The kiss I gave you is bestowed in vain, 
  And all in vain you strive against the stream; 
    For, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse, 
    Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.

  'If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues, 
  And every tongue more moving than your own, 
  Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs, 
  Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown; 
    For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear, 
    And will not let a false sound enter there,

  'Lest the deceiving harmony should run 
  Into the quiet closure of my breast; 
  And then my little heart were quite undone, 
  In his bedchamber to be barred of rest. 
    No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan, 
    But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.

  'What have you urged that I cannot reprove? 
  The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger; 
  I hate not love, but your device in love 
  That lends embracements unto every stranger. 
    You do it for increase: O strange excuse, 
    When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!

  'Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled 
  Since sweating Lust on earth usurped his name; 
  Under whose simple semblance he hath fed 
  Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame; 
    Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves, 
    As caterpillars do the tender leaves.

  'Love comforteth like sunshine after rain, 
  But Lust's effect is tempest after sun; 
  Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain, 
  Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done; 
    Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies; 
    Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.

  'More I could tell, but more I dare not say; 
  The text is old, the orator too green. 
  Therefore, in sadness, now I will away; 
  My face is full of shame, my heart of teen: 
    Mine ears that to your wanton talk attended 
    Do burn themselves for having so offended.'

  With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace 
  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast, 
  And homeward through the dark lawnd runs apace; 
  Leaves Love upon her back deeply distressed. 
    Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky, 
    So glides he in the night from Venus' eye;

  Which after him she darts, as one on shore 
  Gazing upon a late-embarked friend, 
  Till the wild waves will have him seen no more, 
  Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend; 
    So did the merciless and pitchy night 
    Fold in the object that did feed her sight.

  Whereat amazed as one that unaware 
  Hath dropped a precious jewel in the flood, 
  Or 'stonished as night-wand'rers often are, 
  Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood; 
    Even so confounded in the dark she lay, 
    Having lost the fair discovery of her way.

  And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans, 
  That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled, 
  Make verbal repetition of her moans; 
  Passion on passion deeply is redoubled: 
    'Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times, 'Woe, woe!' 
    And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.

  She, marking them, begins a wailing note, 
  And sings extemporally a woeful ditty; 
  How love makes young men thrall, and old men dote; 
  How love is wise in folly, foolish witty: 
    Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe, 
    And still the choir of echoes answer so.

  Her song was tedious, and outwore the night, 
  For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short; 
  If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight 
  In such-like circumstance, with such-like sport. 
    Their copious stories, oftentimes begun, 
    End without audience, and are never done.

  For who hath she to spend the night withal 
  But idle sounds resembling parasites, 
  Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call, 
  Soothing the humour of fantastic wits? 
    She says ''Tis so'; they answer all ''Tis so'; 
    And would say after her, if she said 'No'.

  Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest, 
  From his moist cabinet mounts up on high, 
  And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast 
  The sun ariseth in his majesty; 
    Who doth the world so gloriously behold 
    That cedar-tops and hills seem burnished gold.

  Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow: 
  'O thou clear god, and patron of all light, 
  From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow 
  The beauteous influence that makes him bright, 
    There lives a son that sucked an earthly mother 
    May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'

  This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove, 
  Musing the morning is so much o'erworn, 
  And yet she hears no tidings of her love; 
  She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn. 
    Anon she hears them chant it lustily, 
    And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.

  And as she runs, the bushes in the way 
  Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face, 
  Some twind about her thigh to make her stay; 
  She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace, 
    Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache, 
    Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.

  By this she hears the hounds are at a bay; 
  Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder 
  Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way, 
  The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder; 
    Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds 
    Appals her senses and her spirit confounds.

  For now she knows it is no gentle chase, 
  But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud, 
  Because the cry remaineth in one place, 
  Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud. 
    Finding their enemy to be so curst, 
    They all strain court'sy who shall cope him first.

  This dismal cry rings sadly in her car, 
  Through which it enters to surprise her heart; 
  Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear, 
  With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part; 
    Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield, 
    They basely fly and dare not stay the field.

  Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy; 
  Till, cheering up her senses all dismayed, 
  She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy, 
  And childish error, that they are afraid; 
    Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more; 
    And with that word she spied the hunted boar,

  Whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red, 
  Like milk and blood being mingled both together, 
  A second fear through all her sinews spread, 
  Which madly hurries her she knows not whither: 
    This way she runs, and now she will no further, 
    But back retires to rate the boar for murther.

  A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways; 
  She treads the path that she untreads again; 
  Her more than haste is mated with delays, 
  Like the proceedings of a drunken brain, 
    Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting, 
    In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.

  Here kennelled in a brake she finds a hound, 
  And asks the weary caitiff for his master; 
  And there another licking of his wound, 
  'Gainst venomed sores the only sovereign plaster; 
    And here she meets another sadly scowling, 
    To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.

  When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise, 
  Another flap-mouthed mourner, black and grim, 
  Against the welkin volleys out his voice; 
  Another and another answer him, 
    Clapping their proud tails to the ground below, 
    Shaking their scratched ears, bleeding as they go.

  Look how the world's poor people are amazed 
  At apparitions, signs and prodigies, 
  Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed, 
  Infusing them with dreadful prophecies; 
    So she at these sad signs draws up her breath, 
    And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death.

  'Hard-favoured tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean, 
  Hateful divorce of love'- thus chides she Death- 
  'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean 
  To stifle beauty and to steal his breath 
    Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set 
    Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?

  'If he be dead- O no, it cannot be, 
  Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it- 
  O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see, 
  But hatefully at random dost thou hit. 
    Thy mark is feeble age; but thy false dart 
    Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant's heart.

  'Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke, 
  And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power. 
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke; 
  They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower. 
    Love's golden arrow at him should have fled, 
    And not Death's ebon dart, to strike him dead.

  'Dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping? 
  What may a heavy groan advantage thee? 
  Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping 
  Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see? 
    Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour, 
    Since her best work is ruined with thy rigour.'

  Here overcome as one full of despair, 
  She vailed her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopped 
  The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair 
  In the sweet channel of her bosom dropped; 
    But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain, 
    And with his strong course opens them again.

  O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow! 
  Her eye seen in the tears, tears in her eye; 
  Both crystals, where they viewed each other's sorrow, 
  Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry; 
    But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain, 
    Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.

  Variable passions throng her constant woe, 
  As striving who should best become her grief, 
  All entertained, each passion labours so 
  That every present sorrow seemeth chief, 
    But none is best. Then join they all together, 
    Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.

  By this, far off she hears some huntsman holla; 
  A nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well. 
  The dire imagination she did follow 
  This sound of hope doth labour to expel; 
    For now reviving joy bids her rejoice, 
    And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.

  Whereat her tears began to turn their tide, 
  Being prisoned in her eye like pearls in glass; 
  Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside, 
  Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass 
    To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground, 
    Who is but drunken when she seemeth drowned.

  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems 
  Not to believe, and yet too credulous! 
  Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes; 
  Despair, and hope makes thee ridiculous: 
    The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely, 
    In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.

  Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought; 
  Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame; 
  It was not she that called him all to nought. 
  Now she adds honours to his hateful name; 
    She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings, 
    Imperious supreme of all mortal things.

  'No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest; 
  Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear 
  When as I met the boar, that bloody beast, 
  Which knows no pity, but is still severe. 
    Then, gentle shadow- truth I must confess- 
    I railed on thee, fearing my love's decease.

  ''Tis not my fault: the boar provoked my tongue; 
  Be wreaked on him, invisible commander; 
  'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong; 
  I did but act, he's author of thy slander. 
    Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet 
    Could rule them both withbut ten women's wit.'

  Thus, hoping that Adonis is alive, 
  Her rash suspect she doth extenuate; 
  And that his beauty may the better thrive, 
  With Death she humbly doth insinuate; 
    Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories 
    His victories, his triumphs and his glories.

  'O Jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I 
  To be of such a weak and silly mind 
  To wail his death who lives and must not die 
  Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind! 
    For he being dead, with him is Beauty slain, 
    And, Beauty dead, black Chaos comes again.

  'Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear 
  As one with treasure laden, hemmed with thieves; 
  Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear 
  Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.' 
    Even at this word she hears a merry horn, 
    Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.

  As falcons to the lure, away she flies; 
  The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light; 
  And in her haste unfortunately spies 
  The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight; 
    Which seen, her eyes, as murd'red with the view, 
    Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;

  Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit, 
  Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain, 
  And there all smoth'red up in shade doth sit, 
  Long after fearing to creep forth again; 
    So at his bloody view her eyes are fled 
    Into the deep-dark cabins of her head;

  Where they resign their office and their light 
  To the disposing of her troubled brain; 
  Who bids them still consort with ugly night, 
  And never wound the heart with looks again; 
    Who, like a king perplexed in his throne, 
    By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,

  Whereat each tributary subject quakes; 
  As when the wind, imprisoned in the ground, 
  Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes, 
  Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound. 
    This mutiny each part doth so surprise, 
    That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;

  And being opened, threw unwilling light 
  Upon the wide wound that the boar had trenched 
  In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white 
  With purple tears that his wound wept was drenched: 
    No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf or weed, 
    But stole his blood and seemed with him to bleed.

  This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth; 
  Over one shoulder doth she hang her head; 
  Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth; 
  She thinks he could not die, he is not dead. 
    Her voice is stopped, her joints forget to bow; 
    Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.

  Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly 
  That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three; 
  And then she reprehends her mangling eye 
  That makes more gashes where no breach should be: 
    His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled; 
    For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.

  'My tongue cannot express my grief for one, 
  And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead! 
  My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone, 
  Mine eyes are turned to fire, my heart to lead; 
    Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire! 
    So shall I die by drops of hot desire.

  'Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost! 
  What face remains alive that's worth the viewing? 
  Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast 
  Of things long since, or any thing ensuing? 
    The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim; 
    But true sweet beauty lived and died with him.

  'Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear; 
  Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you. 
  Having no fair to lose, you need not fear; 
  The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you. 
    But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air 
    Lurked like two thieves to rob him of his fair;

  'And therefore would he put his bonnet on, 
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep; 
  The wind would blow it off, and, being gone, 
  Play with his locks. Then would Adonis weep; 
    And straight, in pity of his tender years, 
    They both would strive who first should dry his tears.

  'To see his face the lion walked along 
  Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him; 
  To recreate himself when he hath sung, 
  The tiger would be tame and gently hear him; 
    If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey, 
    And never fright the silly lamb that day.

  'When he beheld his shadow in the brook, 
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills; 
  When he was by, the birds such pleasure took 
  That some would sing, some other in their bills 
    Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries; 
    He fed them with his sight, they him with beffies.

  'But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar, 
  Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave, 
  Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore; 
  Witness the entertainment that he gave. 
    If he did see his face, why then I know 
    He thought to kiss him, and hath killed him so.

  ''Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain: 
  He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear, 
  Who did not whet his teeth at him again, 
  But by a kiss thought to persuade him there; 
    And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine 
    Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.

  'Had I been toothed like him, I must confess, 
  With kissing him I should have killed him first; 
  But he is dead, and never did he bless 
  My youth with his; the more am I accurst.' 
    With this, she falleth in the place she stood, 
    And stains her face with his congealed blood.

  She looks upon his lips, and they are pale; 
  She takes him by the hand, and that is cold; 
  She whispers in his ears a heavy tale, 
  As if they heard the woeful words she told; 
    She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes, 
    Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;

  Two glasses, where herself herself beheld 
  A thousand times, and now no more, reflect; 
  Their virtue lost wherein they late excelled, 
  And every beauty robbed of his effect. 
    'Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite, 
    That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.

  'Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy 
  Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend; 
  It shall be waited on with jealousy, 
  Find sweet beginning but unsavoury end; 
    Ne'er settled equally, but high or low, 
    That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.

  'It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud; 
  Bud, and be blasted, in a breathing while; 
  The bottom poison, and the top o'erstrawed 
  With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile; 
    The strongest body shall it make most weak, 
    Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.

  'It shall be sparing, and too full of riot, 
  Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures; 
  The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet, 
  Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures; 
    It shall be raging-mad, and silly-mild, 
    Make the young old, the old become a child.

  'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear; 
  It shall not fear where it should most mistrust; 
  It shall be merciful and too severe, 
  And most deceiving when it seems most just; 
    Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward, 
    Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.

  'It shall be cause of war and dire events, 
  And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire; 
  Subject and servile to all discontents, 
  As dry combustious matter is to fire. 
    Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy, 
    They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.'

  By this the boy that by her side lay killed 
  Was melted like a vapour from her sight, 
  And in his blood that on the ground lay spilled 
  A purple flower sprung up, chequ'red with white, 
    Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood 
    Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.

  She bows her head the new-sprung flower to smell, 
  Comparing it to her Adonis' breath; 
  And says within her bosom it shall dwell, 
  Since he himself is reft from her by death; 
    She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears 
    Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.

  'Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy father's guise 
  Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire 
  For every little grief to wet his eyes. 
  To grow unto himself was his desire, 
    And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good 
    To wither in my breast as in his blood.

  'Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast; 
  Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right. 
  Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest; 
  My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night; 
    There shall not be one minute in an hour 
    Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'

  Thus weary of the world, away she hies, 
  And yokes her silver doves, by whose swift aid 
  Their mistress, mounted, through the empty skies 
  In her light chariot quickly is conveyed, 
    Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen 
    Means to immure herself and not be seen. 
 

                        -THE END-

VENUS AND ADONIS 
  
Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo 
 Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua
TO THE 
RIGHT HONOURABLE 
HENRY WRIOTHESLEY, 
EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON, AND BARON 
OF TITCHFIELD

Right Honourable, 
  I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to 
your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for choosing so 
strong a prop to support so weak a burden: only, if your honour seem 
but pleased, I account my self highly praised, and vow to take 
advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some graver 
labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I 
shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather, and never after ear so 
barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it 
to your honourable survey, and your honour to your heart's content; 
which I wish may always answer your own wish, and the world's 
hopeful expectations. 
                                    Your honour's in all duty, 
                                           William Shakespeare 
  
 

  
VEN as the sun with purple-coloured face 
  Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn, 
  Rose-cheeked Adonis hied him to the chase; 
  Hunting he loved, but love he laughed to scorn. 
    Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him, 
    And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.

  'Thrice fairer than myself,' thus she began, 
  'The field's chief flower, sweet above compare, 
  Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man, 
  More white and red than doves or roses are; 
    Nature that made thee with herself at strife 
    Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.

  'Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed, 
  And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow; 
  If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed 
  A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know. 
    Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses, 
    And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses;

  'And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed saiety, 
  But rather famish them amid their plenty, 
  Making them red and pale with fresh variety; 
  Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty. 
    A summer's day will seem an hour but short, 
    Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'

  With this she seizeth on his sweating palm, 
  The precedent of pith and livelihood, 
  And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm, 
  Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good. 
    Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force 
    Courageously to pluck him from his horse.

  Over one arm the lusty courser's rein, 
  Under her other was the tender boy, 
  Who blushed and pouted in a dull disdain, 
  With leaden appetite, unapt to toy; 
    She red and hot as coals of glowing fire, 
    He red for shame, but frosty in desire.

  The studded bridle on a ragged bough 
  Nimbly she fastens- O, how quick is love! 
  The steed is stalled up, and even now 
  To tie the rider she begins to prove. 
    Backward she pushed him, as she would be thrust, 
    And governed him in strength, though not in lust.

  So soon was she along as he was down, 
  Each leaning on their elbows and their hips; 
  Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown, 
  And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips, 
    And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken, 
    'If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'

  He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears 
  Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks; 
  Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs 
  To fan and blow them dry again she seeks. 
    He saith she is immodest, blames her miss; 
    What follows more she murders with a kiss.

  Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast, 
  Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone, 
  Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste, 
  Till either gorge be stuffed or prey be gone; 
    Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin, 
    And where she ends she doth anew begin.

  Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should, 
  Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire. 
  Affection is a coal that must be cooled; 
  Else, suffered, it will set the heart on fire. 
    The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none, 
    Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.

  'How like a jade he stood tied to the tree, 
  Servilely mastered with a leathern rein! 
  But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee, 
  He held such petty bondage in disdain, 
    Throwing the base thong from his bending crest, 
    Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.

  'Who sees his true-love in her naked bed, 
  Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white, 
  But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed, 
  His other agents aim at like delight? 
    Who is so faint that dares not be so bold 
    To touch the fire, the weather being cold?

  'Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;' 
  And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee, 
  To take advantage on presented joy; 
  Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee. 
    O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain, 
    And once made perfect, never lost again.'

  'I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it, 
  Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it. 
  'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it. 
  My love to love is love but to disgrace it; 
    For I have heard it is a life in death, 
    That laughs, and weeps, and all but with a breath.

  'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinished? 
  Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth? 
  If springing things be any jot diminished, 
  They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth. 
    The colt that's backed and burdened being young 
    Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.

  'You hurt my hand with wringing; let us part, 
  And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat; 
  Remove your siege from my unyielding heart; 
  To love's alarms it will not ope the gate. 
    Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt'ry; 
    For where a heart is hard they make no batt'ry.'

  'What, canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue? 
  O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing! 
  Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong; 
  I had my load before, now pressed with bearing: 
    Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh sounding, 
    Ears' deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.

  'Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love 
  That inward beauty and invisible; 
  Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move 
  Each part in me that were but sensible. 
    Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see, 
    Yet should I be in love by touching thee.

  'Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me, 
  And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch, 
  And nothing but the very smell were left me, 
  Yet would my love to thee be still as much; 
    For from the stillitory of thy face excelling 
    Comes breath perfumed, that breedeth love by smelling.

  'But O, what banquet wert thou to the taste, 
  Being nurse and feeder of the other four! 
  Would they not wish the feast might ever last, 
  And bid Suspicion double-lock the door, 
    Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest, 
    Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?'

  Once more the ruby-coloured portal opened, 
  Which to his speech did honey passage yield; 
  Like a red morn, that ever yet betokened 
  Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field, 
    Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds, 
    Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.

  This ill presage advisedly she marketh. 
  Even as the wind is hushed before it raineth, 
  Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh, 
  Or as the berry breaks before it staineth, 
    Or like the deadly bullet of a gun, 
    His meaning struck her ere his words begun.

  And at his look she flatly falleth down, 
  For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth; 
  A smile recures the wounding of a frown. 
  But blessed bankrupt that by loss so thriveth! 
    The silly boy, believing she is dead, 
    Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;

  And all amazed brake off his late intent, 
  For sharply he did think to reprehend her, 
  Which cunning love did wittily prevent. 
  Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her! 
    For on the grass she lies as she were slain, 
    Till his breath breatheth life in her again.

  He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks, 
  He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard, 
  He chafes her lips, a thousand ways he seeks 
  To mend the hurt that his unkindness marred; 
    He kisses her; and she, by her good will, 
    Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.

  The night of sorrow now is turned to day: 
  Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth, 
  Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array 
  He cheers the morn, and all the earth relieveth; 
    And as the bright sun glorifies the sky, 
    So is her face illumined with her eye;

  Whose beams upon his hairless face are fixed, 
  As if from thence they borrowed all their shine. 
  Were never four such lamps together mixed, 
  Had not his clouded with his brow's repine; 
    But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light, 
    Shone like the moon in water seen by night.

  Forced to content, but never to obey, 
  Panting he lies and breatheth in her face; 
  She feedeth on the steam as on a prey, 
  And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace, 
    Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers, 
    So they were dewed with such distilling showers.

  Look how a bird lies tangled in a net, 
  So fast'ned in her arms Adonis lies; 
  Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret, 
  Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes. 
    Rain added to a river that is rank 
    Perforce will force it overflow the bank.

  Still she entreats, and prettily entreats, 
  For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale; 
  Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets, 
  'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale; 
    Being red, she loves him best, and being white, 
    Her best is bettered with a more delight.

  Look how he can, she cannot choose but love; 
  And by her fair immortal hand she swears 
  From his soft bosom never to remove 
  Till he take truce with her contending tears, 
    Which long have rained, making her cheeks all wet; 
    And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.

  Upon this promise did he raise his chin, 
  Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave, 
  Who, being looked on, ducks as quickly in; 
  So offers he to give what she did crave; 
    But when her lips were ready for his pay, 
    He winks, and turns his lips another way.

  Never did passenger in summer's heat 
  More thirst for drink than she for this good turn. 
  Her help she sees, but help she cannot get; 
  She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn. 
    'O, pity,' 'gan she cry. 'flint-hearted boy! 
    'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?

  'I have been wooed, as I entreat thee now, 
  Even by the stern and direful god of war, 
  Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow, 
  Who conquers where he comes in every jar; 
    Yet hath he been my captive and my slave, 
    And begged for that which thou unasked shalt have.

  'Over my altars hath he hung his lance, 
  His batt'red shield, his uncontrolled crest, 
  And for my sake hath learned to sport and dance, 
  To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest, 
    Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red, 
    Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.

  'Thus he that overruled I overswayed, 
  Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain; 
  Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obeyed, 
  Yet was he servile to my coy disdain. 
    O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might, 
    For mast'ring her that foiled the god of fight!

  'Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine- 
  Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red- 
  The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine. 
  What see'st thou in the ground? hold up thy head; 
    Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies; 
    Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?

  'Art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again, 
  And I will wink; so shall the day seem night. 
  Love keeps his revels where there are but twain; 
  Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight. 
    These blue-veined violets whereon we lean 
    Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.

  'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip 
  Shews thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted; 
  Make use of time, let not advantage slip; 
  Beauty within itself should not be wasted. 
    Fair flowers that are not gath'red in their prime 
    Rot and consume themselves in little time.

  'Were I hard-favoured, foul, or wrinkled-old, 
  Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice, 
  O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold, 
  Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice, 
    Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee; 
    But having no defects, why dost abhor me?

  'Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow; 
  Mine eyes are grey and bright and quick in turning; 
  My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow, 
  My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning; 
    My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt, 
    Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.

  'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear, 
  Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green, 
  Or, like a nymph, with long dishevelled hair, 
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen. 
    Love is a spirit all compact of fire, 
    Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.

  'Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie; 
  These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me; 
  Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky 
  From morn till night, even where I list to sport me. 
    Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be 
    That thou should think it heavy unto thee?

  'Is thine own heart to thine own face affected? 
  Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left? 
  Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected, 
  Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft. 
    Narcissus so himself forsook, 
    And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.

  'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear, 
  Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use, 
  Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear; 
  Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse. 
    Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty; 
    Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.

  'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed, 
  Unless the earth with thy increase be fed? 
  By law of nature thou art bound to breed, 
  That thine may live when thou thyself art dead; 
    And so in spite of death thou dost survive, 
    In that thy likeness still is left alive.'

  By this, the love-sick queen began to sweat, 
  For where they lay the shadow had forsook them, 
  And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat, 
  With burning eye did hotly overlook them, 
    Wishing Adonis had his team to guide, 
    So he were like him, and by Venus' side.

  And now Adonis, with a lazy sprite, 
  And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye, 
  His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight, 
  Like misty vapours when they blot the sky, 
    Souring his cheeks, cries 'Fie, no more of love! 
    The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.'

  'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind! 
  What bare excuses mak'st thou to be gone! 
  I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind 
  Shall cool the heat of this descending sun; 
    I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs; 
    If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.

  'The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm, 
  And lo, I lie between that sun and thee; 
  The heat I have from thence doth little harm; 
  Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me; 
    And were I not immortal, life were done 
    Between this heavenly and earthly sun.

  'Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel? 
  Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth. 
  Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel 
  What 'tis to love, how want of love tormenteth? 
    O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind, 
    She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.

  'What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this? 
  Or what great danger dwells upon my suit? 
  What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss? 
  Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute. 
    Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again, 
    And one for int'rest, if thou wilt have twain.

  'Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone, 
  Well painted idol, image dull ind dead, 
  Statue contenting but the eye alone, 
  Thing like a man, but of no woman bred! 
    Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion, 
    For men will kiss even by their own direction.'

  This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue, 
  And swelling passion doth provoke a pause; 
  Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong; 
  Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause; 
    And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak, 
    And now her sobs do her intendments break.

  Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand, 
  Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground; 
  Sometime her arms infold him like a band; 
  She would, he will not in her arms be bound; 
    And when from thence he struggles to be gone, 
    She locks her lily fingers one in one.

  'Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemmed thee here 
  Within the circuit of this ivory pale, 
  I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer; 
  Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale; 
    Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry, 
    Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.

  'Within this limit is relief enough, 
  Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain, 
  Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough, 
  To shelter thee from tempest and from rain: 
    Then be my deer, since I am such a park; 
    No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'

  At this Adonis smiles as in disdain, 
  That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple. 
  Love made those hollows, if himself were slain, 
  He might be buried in a tomb so simple; 
    Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie, 
    Why, there Love lived, and there he could not die.

  These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits, 
  Opened their mouths to swallow Venus' liking. 
  Being mad before, how doth she now for wits? 
  Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking? 
    Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn, 
    To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!

  Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say? 
  Her words are done, her woes the more increasing; 
  The time is spent, her object will away, 
  And from her twining arms doth urge releasing. 
    'Pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!' 
    Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.

  But lo, from forth a copse that neighbours by, 
  A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud, 
  Adonis' trampling courser doth espy, 
  And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud. 
    The strong-necked steed, being tied unto a tree, 
    Breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he.

  Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds, 
  And now his woven girths he breaks asunder; 
  The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds, 
  Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder; 
    The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth, 
    Controlling what he was controlled with.

  His ears up-pricked; his braided hanging mane 
  Upon his compassed crest now stand on end; 
  His nostrils drink the air, and forth again, 
  As from a furnace, vapours doth he send; 
    His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire, 
    Shows his hot courage and his high desire.

  Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps, 
  With gentle majesty and modest pride; 
  Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps, 
  As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried, 
    And this I do to captivate the eye 
    Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'

  What recketh he his rider's angry stir, 
  His flattering 'Holla' or his 'Stand, I say?' 
  What cares he now for curb or pricking spur? 
  For rich caparisons or trappings gay? 
    He sees his love, and nothing else he sees, 
    For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.

  Look when a painter would surpass the life 
  In limning out a well-proportioned steed, 
  His art with nature's workmanship at strife, 
  As if the dead the living should exceed; 
    So did this horse excel a common one 
    In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.

  Round-hoofed, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long, 
  Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide, 
  High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong, 
  Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide; 
    Look what a horse should have he did not lack, 
    Save a proud rider on so proud a back.

  Sometime he scuds far off, and there he stares; 
  Anon he starts at stirring of a feather; 
  To bid the wind a base he now prepares, 
  And whe'er he run or fly they know not whether; 
    For through his mane and tail the high wind sings, 
    Fanning the hairs, who wave like feath'red wings.

  He looks upon his love and neighs unto her; 
  She answers him as if she knew his mind; 
  Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her, 
  She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind, 
    Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels, 
    Beating his kind embracements with her heels.

  Then, like a melancholy malcontent, 
  He vails his tail, that, like a falling plume, 
  Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent; 
  He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume. 
    His love, perceiving how he was enraged, 
    Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.

  His testy master goeth about to take him, 
  When, lo, the unbacked breeder, full of fear, 
  Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him, 
  With her the horse, and left Adonis there. 
    As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them, 
    Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.

  All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits, 
  Banning his boist'rous and unruly beast; 
  And now the happy season once more fits 
  That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest; 
    For lovers say the heart hath treble wrong 
    When it is barred the aidance of the tongue.

  An oven that is stopped, or river stayed, 
  Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage; 
  So of concealed sorrow may be said, 
  Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage; 
    But when the heart's attorney once is mute, 
    The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.

  He sees her coming, and begins to glow, 
  Even as a dying coal revives with wind, 
  And with his bonnet hides his angry brow, 
  Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind, 
    Taking no notice that she is so nigh, 
    For all askance he holds her in his eye.

  O, what a sight it was, wistly to view 
  How she came stealing to the wayward boy! 
  To note the fighting conflict of her hue, 
  How white and red each other did destroy! 
    But now her cheek was pale, and by and by 
    It flashed forth fire, as lightning from the sky.

  Now was she just before him as he sat, 
  And like a lowly lover down she kneels; 
  With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat, 
  Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels; 
    His tend'rer cheek receives her soft hand's print 
    As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.

  O, what a war of looks was then between them, 
  Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing! 
  His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them; 
  Her eyes wooed still, his eyes disdained the wooing; 
    And all this dumb play had his acts made plain 
    With tears which chorus-like her eyes did rain.

  Full gently now she takes him by the hand, 
  A lily prisoned in a gaol of snow, 
  Or ivory in an alabaster band; 
  So white a friend engirts so white a foe: 
    This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling, 
    Showed like two silver doves that sit a-billing.

  Once more the engine of her thoughts began: 
  'O fairest mover on this mortal round, 
  Would thou wert as I am, and I a man, 
  My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound; 
    For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee, 
    Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee.'

  'Give me my hand,' saith he; 'why dost thou feel it?' 
  'Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it; 
  O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it, 
  And being steeled, soft sighs can never grave it; 
    Then love's deep groans I never shall regard, 
    Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'

  'For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go; 
  My day's delight is past, my horse is gone, 
  And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so. 
  I pray you hence, and leave me here alone; 
    For all my mind, my thought, my busy care, 
    Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'

  'O, where am I?' quoth she; 'in earth or heaven, 
  Or in the ocean drenched, or in the fire? 
  What hour is this? or morn or weary even? 
  Do I delight to die, or life desire? 
    But now I lived, and life was death's annoy; 
    But now I died, and death was lively joy.

  'O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again. 
  Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine, 
  Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain 
  That they have murd'red this poor heart of mine; 
    And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen, 
    But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.

  'Long may they kiss each other, for this cure! 
  O, never let their crimson liveries wear! 
  And as they last, their verdure still endure 
  To drive infection from the dangerous year! 
    That the star-gazers, having writ on death, 
    May say, the plague is banished by thy breath.

  'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted, 
  What bargains may I make, still to be sealing? 
  To sell myself I can be well contented, 
  So thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing; 
    Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips 
    Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips.

  'A thousand kisses buys my heart from me; 
  And pay them at thy leisure, one by one. 
  What is ten hundred touches unto thee? 
  Are they not quickly told and quickly gone? 
    Say for non-payment that the debt should double, 
    Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?'

  'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me, 
  Measure my strangeness with my unripe years; 
  Before I know myself, seek not to know me; 
  No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears. 
    The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast, 
    Or being early plucked is sour to taste.

  'Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait, 
  His day's hot task hath ended in the west; 
  The owl, night's herald, shrieks 'tis very late; 
  The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest; 
    And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light 
    Do summon us to part, and bid good night.

  'Now let me say "Good night", and so say you; 
  If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.' 
  'Good night', quoth she; and, ere he says 'Adieu', 
  The honey fee of parting tend'red is: 
    Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace; 
    Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.

  Till breathless he disjoined, and backward drew 
  The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth, 
  Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew, 
  Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth. 
    He with her plenty pressed, she faint with dearth, 
    Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.

  Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey, 
  And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth; 
  Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey, 
  Paying what ransom the insulter willeth; 
    Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high 
    That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry.

  And having felt the sweetness of the spoil, 
  With blindfold fury she begins to forage; 
  Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil, 
  And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage. 
    Planting oblivion, beating reason back, 
    Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.

  Hot, faint and weary, with her, hard embracing, 
  Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling, 
  Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing, 
  Or like the froward infant stilled with dandling, 
    He now obeys and now no more resisteth, 
    While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.

  What wax so frozen but dissolves with temp'ring, 
  And yields at last to every light impression? 
  Things out of hope are compass'd oft with vent'ring, 
  Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission: 
    Affection faints not like a pale-face coward, 
    But then woos best when most his choice is froward.

  When he did frown, O, had she then gave over, 
  Such nectar from his lips she had not sucked. 
  Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover; 
  What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis plucked. 
    Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast, 
    Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last.

  For pity now she can no more detain him; 
  The poor fool prays her that he may depart. 
  She is resolved no longer to restrain him; 
  Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart, 
    The which by Cupid's bow she doth protest 
    He carries thence incaged in his breast.

  'Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow, 
  For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch. 
  Tell me, love's master, shall we meet to-morrow? 
  Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?' 
    He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends 
    To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.

  'The boar!' quoth she: whereat a sudden pale, 
  Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose, 
  Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale, 
  And on his neck her yoking arms she throws. 
    She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck, 
    He on her belly falls, she on her back.

  Now is she in the very lists of love, 
  Her champion mounted for the hot encounter. 
  All is imaginary she doth prove; 
  He will not manage her, although he mount her; 
    That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy, 
    To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.

  Even so poor birds, deceived with painted grapes, 
  Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw; 
  Even so she languisheth in her mishaps 
  As those poor birds that helpless berries saw. 
    The warm effects which she in him finds missing 
    She seeks to kindly with continual kissing.

  But all in vain, good queen, it will not be. 
  She hath assayed as much as may be proved; 
  Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee; 
  She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved. 
    'Fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go; 
    You have no reason to withhold me so.'

  'Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this, 
  But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar. 
  O, be advised: thou know'st not what it is 
  With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore, 
    Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still, 
    Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.

  'On his bow-back he hath a battle set 
  Of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes; 
  His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret; 
  His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes; 
    Being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way, 
    And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay.

  'His brawny sides, with hairy bristles armed, 
  Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter; 
  His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed; 
  Being ireful, on the lion he will venter: 
    The thorny brambles and embracing bushes, 
    As fearful of him, part; through whom he rushes.

  'Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine, 
  To which Love's eyes pays tributary gazes; 
  Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne, 
  Whose full perfection all the world amazes; 
    But having thee at vantage- wondrous dread!- 
    Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.

  'O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still; 
  Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends. 
  Come not within his danger by thy will; 
  They that thrive well take counsel of their friends. 
    When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble, 
    I feared thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.

  'Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white? 
  Saws't thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye? 
  Grew I not faint? and fell I not downright? 
  Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie, 
    My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest, 
    But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.

  'For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy 
  Doth call himself Affection's sentinel; 
  Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny, 
  And in a peaceful hour doth cry "Kill, kill!" 
    Distemp'ring gentle Love in his desire, 
    As air and water do abate the fire.

  'This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy, 
  This canker that eats up Love's tender spring, 
  This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy, 
  That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring, 
    Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear 
    That if I love thee I thy death should fear;

  'And more than so, presenteth to mine eye 
  The picture of an angry chafing boar 
  Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie 
  An image like thyself, all stained with gore; 
    Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed 
    Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.

  'What should I do, seeing thee so indeed, 
  That tremble at th'imagination? 
  The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed, 
  And fear doth teach it divination: 
    I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow, 
    If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.

  'But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me; 
  Uncouple at the timorous flying hare, 
  Or at the fox which lives by subtlety, 
  Or at the roe which no encounter dare. 
    Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs, 
    And on thy well-breathed horse keep with thy hounds.

  'And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare, 
  Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles, 
  How he outruns the wind, and with what care 
  He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles. 
    The many musits through the which he goes 
    Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.

  'Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep, 
  To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell, 
  And sometime where earth-delving conies keep, 
  To stop the loud pursuers in their yell; 
    And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer. 
    Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear.

  'For there his smell with others being mingled, 
  The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt, 
  Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled 
  With much ado the cold fault cleanly out. 
    Then do they spend their mouths; Echo replies, 
    As if another chase were in the skies.

  'By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill, 
  Stands on his hinder legs with list'ning ear, 
  To hearken if his foes pursue him still; 
  Anon their loud alarums he doth hear; 
    And now his grief may be compared well 
    To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.

  'Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch 
  Turn, and return, indenting with the way; 
  Each envious brier his weary legs do scratch, 
  Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay; 
    For misery is trodden on by many, 
    And being low never relieved by any.

  'Lie quietly and hear a little more; 
  Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise. 
  To make thee hate the hunting of the boar, 
  Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize, 
    Applying this to that, and so to so; 
    For love can comment upon every woe.

  'Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he; 
  'Leave me, and then the story aptly ends. 
  The night is spent.' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she. 
  'I am', quoth he, 'expected of my friends; 
    And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.' 
    'In night', quoth she, 'desire sees best of all.

  'But if thou fall, O, then imagine this, 
  The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips, 
  And all is but to rob thee of a kiss. 
  Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips 
    Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn, 
    Lest she should steal a kiss, and die forsworn.

  'Now of this dark night I perceive the reason: 
  Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine, 
  Till forging Nature be condemned of treason, 
  For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine, 
    Wherein she framed thee, in high heaven's despite, 
    To shame the sun by day and her by night.

  'And therefore hath she bribed the Destinies 
  To cross the curious workmanship of Nature, 
  To mingle beauty with infirmities 
  And pure perfection with impure defeature, 
    Making it subject to the tyranny 
    Of mad mischances and much misery;

  'As burning fevers, agues pale and faint, 
  Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood, 
  The marrow-eating sickness whose attaint 
  Disorder breeds by heating of the blood, 
    Surfeits, imposthumes, grief and damned despair, 
    Swear Nature's death for framing thee so fair.

  'And not the least of all these maladies 
  But in one minute's fight brings beauty under. 
  Both favour, savour, hue and qualities, 
  Whereat th'impartial gazer late did wonder, 
    Are on the sudden wasted, thawed and done, 
    As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.

  'Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity, 
  Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns, 
  That on the earth would breed a scarcity 
  And barren dearth of daughters and of sons, 
    Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night 
    Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.

  'What is thy body but a swallowing grave, 
  Seeming to bury that posterity 
  Which by the rights of time thou needs must have, 
  If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity? 
    If so, the world will hold thee in disdain, 
    Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.

  'So in thyself thyself art made away; 
  A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife, 
  Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay, 
  Or butcher sire that reaves his son of life. 
    Foul cank'ring rust the hidden treasure frets, 
    But gold that's put to use more gold begets.'

  'Nay, then,' quoth Adon, you will fall again 
  Into your idle over-handied theme; 
  The kiss I gave you is bestowed in vain, 
  And all in vain you strive against the stream; 
    For, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse, 
    Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.

  'If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues, 
  And every tongue more moving than your own, 
  Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs, 
  Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown; 
    For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear, 
    And will not let a false sound enter there,

  'Lest the deceiving harmony should run 
  Into the quiet closure of my breast; 
  And then my little heart were quite undone, 
  In his bedchamber to be barred of rest. 
    No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan, 
    But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.

  'What have you urged that I cannot reprove? 
  The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger; 
  I hate not love, but your device in love 
  That lends embracements unto every stranger. 
    You do it for increase: O strange excuse, 
    When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!

  'Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled 
  Since sweating Lust on earth usurped his name; 
  Under whose simple semblance he hath fed 
  Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame; 
    Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves, 
    As caterpillars do the tender leaves.

  'Love comforteth like sunshine after rain, 
  But Lust's effect is tempest after sun; 
  Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain, 
  Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done; 
    Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies; 
    Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.

  'More I could tell, but more I dare not say; 
  The text is old, the orator too green. 
  Therefore, in sadness, now I will away; 
  My face is full of shame, my heart of teen: 
    Mine ears that to your wanton talk attended 
    Do burn themselves for having so offended.'

  With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace 
  Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast, 
  And homeward through the dark lawnd runs apace; 
  Leaves Love upon her back deeply distressed. 
    Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky, 
    So glides he in the night from Venus' eye;

  Which after him she darts, as one on shore 
  Gazing upon a late-embarked friend, 
  Till the wild waves will have him seen no more, 
  Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend; 
    So did the merciless and pitchy night 
    Fold in the object that did feed her sight.

  Whereat amazed as one that unaware 
  Hath dropped a precious jewel in the flood, 
  Or 'stonished as night-wand'rers often are, 
  Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood; 
    Even so confounded in the dark she lay, 
    Having lost the fair discovery of her way.

  And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans, 
  That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled, 
  Make verbal repetition of her moans; 
  Passion on passion deeply is redoubled: 
    'Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times, 'Woe, woe!' 
    And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.

  She, marking them, begins a wailing note, 
  And sings extemporally a woeful ditty; 
  How love makes young men thrall, and old men dote; 
  How love is wise in folly, foolish witty: 
    Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe, 
    And still the choir of echoes answer so.

  Her song was tedious, and outwore the night, 
  For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short; 
  If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight 
  In such-like circumstance, with such-like sport. 
    Their copious stories, oftentimes begun, 
    End without audience, and are never done.

  For who hath she to spend the night withal 
  But idle sounds resembling parasites, 
  Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call, 
  Soothing the humour of fantastic wits? 
    She says ''Tis so'; they answer all ''Tis so'; 
    And would say after her, if she said 'No'.

  Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest, 
  From his moist cabinet mounts up on high, 
  And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast 
  The sun ariseth in his majesty; 
    Who doth the world so gloriously behold 
    That cedar-tops and hills seem burnished gold.

  Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow: 
  'O thou clear god, and patron of all light, 
  From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow 
  The beauteous influence that makes him bright, 
    There lives a son that sucked an earthly mother 
    May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'

  This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove, 
  Musing the morning is so much o'erworn, 
  And yet she hears no tidings of her love; 
  She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn. 
    Anon she hears them chant it lustily, 
    And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.

  And as she runs, the bushes in the way 
  Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face, 
  Some twind about her thigh to make her stay; 
  She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace, 
    Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache, 
    Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.

  By this she hears the hounds are at a bay; 
  Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder 
  Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way, 
  The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder; 
    Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds 
    Appals her senses and her spirit confounds.

  For now she knows it is no gentle chase, 
  But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud, 
  Because the cry remaineth in one place, 
  Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud. 
    Finding their enemy to be so curst, 
    They all strain court'sy who shall cope him first.

  This dismal cry rings sadly in her car, 
  Through which it enters to surprise her heart; 
  Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear, 
  With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part; 
    Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield, 
    They basely fly and dare not stay the field.

  Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy; 
  Till, cheering up her senses all dismayed, 
  She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy, 
  And childish error, that they are afraid; 
    Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more; 
    And with that word she spied the hunted boar,

  Whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red, 
  Like milk and blood being mingled both together, 
  A second fear through all her sinews spread, 
  Which madly hurries her she knows not whither: 
    This way she runs, and now she will no further, 
    But back retires to rate the boar for murther.

  A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways; 
  She treads the path that she untreads again; 
  Her more than haste is mated with delays, 
  Like the proceedings of a drunken brain, 
    Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting, 
    In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.

  Here kennelled in a brake she finds a hound, 
  And asks the weary caitiff for his master; 
  And there another licking of his wound, 
  'Gainst venomed sores the only sovereign plaster; 
    And here she meets another sadly scowling, 
    To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.

  When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise, 
  Another flap-mouthed mourner, black and grim, 
  Against the welkin volleys out his voice; 
  Another and another answer him, 
    Clapping their proud tails to the ground below, 
    Shaking their scratched ears, bleeding as they go.

  Look how the world's poor people are amazed 
  At apparitions, signs and prodigies, 
  Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed, 
  Infusing them with dreadful prophecies; 
    So she at these sad signs draws up her breath, 
    And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death.

  'Hard-favoured tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean, 
  Hateful divorce of love'- thus chides she Death- 
  'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean 
  To stifle beauty and to steal his breath 
    Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set 
    Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?

  'If he be dead- O no, it cannot be, 
  Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it- 
  O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see, 
  But hatefully at random dost thou hit. 
    Thy mark is feeble age; but thy false dart 
    Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant's heart.

  'Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke, 
  And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power. 
  The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke; 
  They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower. 
    Love's golden arrow at him should have fled, 
    And not Death's ebon dart, to strike him dead.

  'Dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping? 
  What may a heavy groan advantage thee? 
  Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping 
  Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see? 
    Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour, 
    Since her best work is ruined with thy rigour.'

  Here overcome as one full of despair, 
  She vailed her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopped 
  The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair 
  In the sweet channel of her bosom dropped; 
    But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain, 
    And with his strong course opens them again.

  O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow! 
  Her eye seen in the tears, tears in her eye; 
  Both crystals, where they viewed each other's sorrow, 
  Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry; 
    But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain, 
    Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.

  Variable passions throng her constant woe, 
  As striving who should best become her grief, 
  All entertained, each passion labours so 
  That every present sorrow seemeth chief, 
    But none is best. Then join they all together, 
    Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.

  By this, far off she hears some huntsman holla; 
  A nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well. 
  The dire imagination she did follow 
  This sound of hope doth labour to expel; 
    For now reviving joy bids her rejoice, 
    And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.

  Whereat her tears began to turn their tide, 
  Being prisoned in her eye like pearls in glass; 
  Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside, 
  Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass 
    To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground, 
    Who is but drunken when she seemeth drowned.

  O hard-believing love, how strange it seems 
  Not to believe, and yet too credulous! 
  Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes; 
  Despair, and hope makes thee ridiculous: 
    The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely, 
    In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.

  Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought; 
  Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame; 
  It was not she that called him all to nought. 
  Now she adds honours to his hateful name; 
    She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings, 
    Imperious supreme of all mortal things.

  'No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest; 
  Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear 
  When as I met the boar, that bloody beast, 
  Which knows no pity, but is still severe. 
    Then, gentle shadow- truth I must confess- 
    I railed on thee, fearing my love's decease.

  ''Tis not my fault: the boar provoked my tongue; 
  Be wreaked on him, invisible commander; 
  'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong; 
  I did but act, he's author of thy slander. 
    Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet 
    Could rule them both withbut ten women's wit.'

  Thus, hoping that Adonis is alive, 
  Her rash suspect she doth extenuate; 
  And that his beauty may the better thrive, 
  With Death she humbly doth insinuate; 
    Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories 
    His victories, his triumphs and his glories.

  'O Jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I 
  To be of such a weak and silly mind 
  To wail his death who lives and must not die 
  Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind! 
    For he being dead, with him is Beauty slain, 
    And, Beauty dead, black Chaos comes again.

  'Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear 
  As one with treasure laden, hemmed with thieves; 
  Trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear 
  Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.' 
    Even at this word she hears a merry horn, 
    Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.

  As falcons to the lure, away she flies; 
  The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light; 
  And in her haste unfortunately spies 
  The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight; 
    Which seen, her eyes, as murd'red with the view, 
    Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;

  Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit, 
  Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain, 
  And there all smoth'red up in shade doth sit, 
  Long after fearing to creep forth again; 
    So at his bloody view her eyes are fled 
    Into the deep-dark cabins of her head;

  Where they resign their office and their light 
  To the disposing of her troubled brain; 
  Who bids them still consort with ugly night, 
  And never wound the heart with looks again; 
    Who, like a king perplexed in his throne, 
    By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,

  Whereat each tributary subject quakes; 
  As when the wind, imprisoned in the ground, 
  Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes, 
  Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound. 
    This mutiny each part doth so surprise, 
    That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;

  And being opened, threw unwilling light 
  Upon the wide wound that the boar had trenched 
  In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white 
  With purple tears that his wound wept was drenched: 
    No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf or weed, 
    But stole his blood and seemed with him to bleed.

  This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth; 
  Over one shoulder doth she hang her head; 
  Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth; 
  She thinks he could not die, he is not dead. 
    Her voice is stopped, her joints forget to bow; 
    Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.

  Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly 
  That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three; 
  And then she reprehends her mangling eye 
  That makes more gashes where no breach should be: 
    His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled; 
    For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.

  'My tongue cannot express my grief for one, 
  And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead! 
  My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone, 
  Mine eyes are turned to fire, my heart to lead; 
    Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire! 
    So shall I die by drops of hot desire.

  'Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost! 
  What face remains alive that's worth the viewing? 
  Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast 
  Of things long since, or any thing ensuing? 
    The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim; 
    But true sweet beauty lived and died with him.

  'Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear; 
  Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you. 
  Having no fair to lose, you need not fear; 
  The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you. 
    But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air 
    Lurked like two thieves to rob him of his fair;

  'And therefore would he put his bonnet on, 
  Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep; 
  The wind would blow it off, and, being gone, 
  Play with his locks. Then would Adonis weep; 
    And straight, in pity of his tender years, 
    They both would strive who first should dry his tears.

  'To see his face the lion walked along 
  Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him; 
  To recreate himself when he hath sung, 
  The tiger would be tame and gently hear him; 
    If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey, 
    And never fright the silly lamb that day.

  'When he beheld his shadow in the brook, 
  The fishes spread on it their golden gills; 
  When he was by, the birds such pleasure took 
  That some would sing, some other in their bills 
    Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries; 
    He fed them with his sight, they him with beffies.

  'But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar, 
  Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave, 
  Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore; 
  Witness the entertainment that he gave. 
    If he did see his face, why then I know 
    He thought to kiss him, and hath killed him so.

  ''Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain: 
  He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear, 
  Who did not whet his teeth at him again, 
  But by a kiss thought to persuade him there; 
    And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine 
    Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.

  'Had I been toothed like him, I must confess, 
  With kissing him I should have killed him first; 
  But he is dead, and never did he bless 
  My youth with his; the more am I accurst.' 
    With this, she falleth in the place she stood, 
    And stains her face with his congealed blood.

  She looks upon his lips, and they are pale; 
  She takes him by the hand, and that is cold; 
  She whispers in his ears a heavy tale, 
  As if they heard the woeful words she told; 
    She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes, 
    Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;

  Two glasses, where herself herself beheld 
  A thousand times, and now no more, reflect; 
  Their virtue lost wherein they late excelled, 
  And every beauty robbed of his effect. 
    'Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite, 
    That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.

  'Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy 
  Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend; 
  It shall be waited on with jealousy, 
  Find sweet beginning but unsavoury end; 
    Ne'er settled equally, but high or low, 
    That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.

  'It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud; 
  Bud, and be blasted, in a breathing while; 
  The bottom poison, and the top o'erstrawed 
  With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile; 
    The strongest body shall it make most weak, 
    Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.

  'It shall be sparing, and too full of riot, 
  Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures; 
  The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet, 
  Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures; 
    It shall be raging-mad, and silly-mild, 
    Make the young old, the old become a child.

  'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear; 
  It shall not fear where it should most mistrust; 
  It shall be merciful and too severe, 
  And most deceiving when it seems most just; 
    Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward, 
    Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.

  'It shall be cause of war and dire events, 
  And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire; 
  Subject and servile to all discontents, 
  As dry combustious matter is to fire. 
    Sith in his prime death doth my love destroy, 
    They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.'

  By this the boy that by her side lay killed 
  Was melted like a vapour from her sight, 
  And in his blood that on the ground lay spilled 
  A purple flower sprung up, chequ'red with white, 
    Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood 
    Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.

  She bows her head the new-sprung flower to smell, 
  Comparing it to her Adonis' breath; 
  And says within her bosom it shall dwell, 
  Since he himself is reft from her by death; 
    She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears 
    Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.

  'Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy father's guise 
  Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire 
  For every little grief to wet his eyes. 
  To grow unto himself was his desire, 
    And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good 
    To wither in my breast as in his blood.

  'Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast; 
  Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right. 
  Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest; 
  My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night; 
    There shall not be one minute in an hour 
    Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'

  Thus weary of the world, away she hies, 
  And yokes her silver doves, by whose swift aid 
  Their mistress, mounted, through the empty skies 
  In her light chariot quickly is conveyed, 
    Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen 
    Means to immure herself and not be seen. 
 

                        -THE END-
